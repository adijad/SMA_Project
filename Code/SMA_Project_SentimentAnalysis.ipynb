      "Review: Fucking great. Soundtrack was incredible, just fucking insane. \"Enemy\" and \"Playground\" were two of the best ones. Writing was pretty good, and it's more about the care and detail to the narratives than the skill of the writers. I would often see cliches and classical tropes executed, but the amount of work that went into making them unique and different was just a lot. Their characters were far better though, with each being tied to the world and others in varying different ways. A good example of this would be the relationship between Vander and Silco. Their fates all tie back to their actions, and what started it all. \n",

      "Animation was simply superb. People who don't have experience in 3D-design won't understand this, but this is simply a technological marvel. The artstyle of the cartoon seems to resemble that of 2D-artwork, and things are rendered differently in 3D-space compared to 2D. Plus, the simple fact that they managed to create methods to have reflections or shading resembles flat 2D art that dynamically reacts to the environment is unbelievable. It's reasonable on a smaller scale, but this? I cannot believe it. Fortiche better be awarded every medal in the book for this. Every frame seems like it was drawn independently.\n",

      "Review: This is one of the best kids genre TV shows ever done. The show appeals to both kids and adults alike, because of how well the story was written. Sure it has some goofy moments in it, but that is OK, because it did not break the continuity of the story. The second thing is how great the story arch and character development were done. The story draws you into caring about the characters which always makes a good story!  I plan on watching this again and again!\n",

Even more so when every minute detail that might seem insignificant to most of the audience is extremely taken care of. It's only when one tries to assimilate every single detail , he gets a glimpse of abundance of foreshadowings throughout the show which makes it obvious that the complete plotline was already planned before season 1.The more the effort you put into watching the show , the more the exhilaration and reward. The show covers wide aspects of science , metaphysics , spirituality and intertwines them like no other.

      "The story suffers for it, so why am I once again enjoying it so much? Hard to say, I just can't stop watching and caring for these characters and, having just watched episode 7, the story line is at a precipice, can go either way of ratching up the level and becoming more than just a rather simplistic racism story posing, but not seriously or convincingly so, as a gangland story or it can rise to a mythological level as previous seasons did that amounts to more than a perfunctory tale of the corpse of the American dream on the slab of history it threatens to become.\n",

For Fargo Season 4, the creators have been overcome and blinded by the political fashions of today. They've chosen to present to you the past as they wish to imagine it, rather than the world as it was. A white banker did not pass up on the idea of the credit card because it was presented to him by a black man. White hospital administrators were not refusing to help dying Italians because of their race. How can two female convicts escape from Alcatraz, when the prison never housed a single female convict? I can't trust the message of the story because they rank modern social justice narratives over truth.\n",

      "Review: Like it or not, reviving dead characters is as well-cemented a hallmark of comic books as they come, and now several dozen entries into the franchise behemoth, it was only a matter of time before fan favorites of the Marvel Cinematic Universe started coming back for seconds. Agents of SHIELD did it first with a post-Avengers Phil Coulson nearly eight years ago, and the results were pretty darn good. So, after a similarly noble, character-defining sacrifice in Avengers: Infinity War, how's the god of mischief doing double-dipping out of the afterlife with his own new show, Loki?\n",
      "\n",
      "We come back to the big time heist in Avengers: Endgame to get the ball rolling for the latest in Disney+'s growing Marvel catalogue. After Iron Man and Ant-Man screw up acquiring the Tesseract Infinity Stone in 2012 New York, this past version of Loki (Tom Hiddleston) makes off with it and teleports to a desert in the middle of nowhere. Before he can celebrate his escape, soldiers from an organization known as the Time Variance Authority sequester him and put him on trial for violating the ordained flow of events of the \"Sacred Timeline.\" Unlike other \"variants\" who unwittingly breach the passage of fate, this Loki is spared by Agent Mobius (Owen Wilson, wow!), a high-ranking member of the TVA who tracks down time criminals and resets the branching timelines they create. Mobius is hunting down a particularly dangerous variant and enlists him to help find the rogue, but as their quest winds into several steep twists and turns, Loki begins to doubt where the mysterious TVA's true intentions lay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question on everyone's mind going into the series was, without a doubt, \"how is Marvel going to justify bringing everyone's favorite villain/hero/goon back?\" Loki was given a complete and satisfying arc across the MCU's first three phases, and his show does set aim at digging deeper into the psyche of a man who wants to be good, but relishes being bad more. After setting up his ambitions and bitter jealousies in the first Thor and The Avengers, The Dark World began Loki's redemption while bridging the distance with his brother through their shared love of their mother. The struggle between his scheming nature and familial morals reached its height in Ragnarok, and it's through a final atonement with Thor, finding a greater purpose in saving Asgard, and sacrificing himself to save both at the brutal opening of Infinity War that Loki's arc was perfectly concluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The show's first episode does a decent job at getting the 2012 post-Avengers Loki up to speed with his deceased counterpart's development, but from there on out, the dive into this variant's inner gears just restates the actions of the big, emotional journey the character's already taken on the big screen with stuffy dialogue that add nothing new to what we already know about him. The only true new development Loki throws on the table is revealing he's gender fluid and bisexual (because we've seen so much of him as a sexual entity before, Nordic lore aside) in a few throwaway lines. So, great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Loki ends up feeling dreadfully, consistently slow from retreading this familiar ground, its long, conversation-heavy scenes never coming across as interesting as they think they are. Kate Herron's direction across all six episodes tries to steep the series into slower, deeper introspection with deliberate, steady heart-to-hearts set against majestic cosmic landscapes but, again, because we already know what makes its lead tick, the series becomes more frustratingly lethargic than emotionally intimate. It's so unengaging that the noticeably expensive, artistically shot set pieces (all gorgeous, by the way, particularly the awesomely retro TVA headquarters) come across as pretentious slaps to the face, even with good performances inhabiting them all around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hiddleston is as good as ever, adding a newfound melancholic bent to the delectably conniving energy that's made Loki a favorite of the MCU for more than ten years. Because of the narrative he's in, though, it's all kind of for nought. Wilson, meanwhile, brings his usual oddball energy with great sincerity and effect as Mobius, whose kindly hard-boiled ‘tude makes for yet another memorable character in the franchise you won't soon get enough of. Also of note, Lovecraft Country's Wunmi Mosaku and Gugu Mbatha-Raw are rock-solid, but underused as TVA Agent Hunter B-15 and Judge Ravonna Renslayer, and Tara Strong shines in spurts as the country-fried AI assistant, Miss Minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Loki's biggest bombshell, though, comes in Sophia Di Martino's outing as Sylvie, a newish character whose introduction is spoiler-heavy enough that I won't get into much more detail. Di Martino makes herself welcome in the role with a brash energy that contrasts nicely with Hiddleston's Loki in more ways than one, though these same characteristics are let down by one-note writing that fails to round the show's second lead into a complete, fulfilling personality within this six episode run.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's largely because, despite his name being the series title, Loki is really more of a setup for the next big, overarching storyline of the MCU through to its closing few minutes. Except for the show's only high point in Episode 5, \"Journey into Mystery,\" which features fantastic guest stars (including a crocodile), Easter eggs, and a 65% tap into the series' nutty true potential, Loki is so passive throughout this season's events (and recycled when given the spotlight) that Marvel could have thrown pretty much any other character into the TVA storyline and achieved the same results. The show's already been renewed for a second season, and now that the domino trail has been tipped for the future of the MCU, maybe then it'll be able to give its characters the meaty drama and pathos they deserve. For the moment being, though, Loki's laboriously drawling story and directing leave it as occasionally essential viewing for MCU completionists, but bad television for everyone else.\n",

Newcomer Iman Vellani brings the character of Kamala Khan to life really well. The unique style of camerawork and visuals creates a tone and pace that makes this series enjoyable. However, Ms. Marvel is one of the examples that shows why the 6-episode formula may not work that well for the MCU series. While the series kept a good pace in the first half, in the second half, the storytelling becomes a little unbalanced and the pacing was thrown off a little. Overall, Ms. Marvel was an enjoyable experience and one of the MCU's better series so far.\n",

For example Fifth Brothers voice was horrible; it sounded like he was out of breath every time he talked and he kept making these weird grunts and noises that actually made me cringe. Third sister was a bad actor as well. Every time she came on screen I felt as if I was watching her audition tape (that wasn't good). When I watch some characters I forget I'm watching a fictional show, but instead for her it was blatantly obvious I was watching this lady try to play a badass, intimidating, and complicated character but she made it came across as bitchy and cringe. Last episode was the best. Mostly because of the fight between Kenobi and Vader.\n",

So what you get here is another broken Jedi (remember Luke in sequels) that somehow forgot all his training and lost all his skills and became a coward. Suddenly the show revolves around little Leia, who is pictured as wonder child, speaking like an adult and escaping bonty hunters on her 10 years old legs and Reva, an inquisitor.Obi wan forgot how to use a lightsaber, and ofc another woman saves him. So if you are a Star Wars fan , i could go on but in a nutshell its a destruction of a character, again, which made my blood boil. If you arent a Star wars fan, its still a really badly written show with plenty of plot holes and parts that look like a farce. On the good side a few scenes are good, and generally imho the production value is high.Im sad that Ewan took part in this, he is such a good actor and likable person.\n",

      "Review: Worst addition to the Star Wars universe, and a terrible show in general. Every episode broke canon, and was illogical and incoherent. Hopefully the writers will never be attached to another Star Wars project. From Obi-Wan feeding a herbivore (eopie) meat to Bail Organa risking the entire Rebellion/his daughter's life by asking one of the most wanted people in the galaxy (Obi-Wan) who has not been keeping informed of new technological developments/in fighting trim/understanding new processes under the Empire for travel and would likely be executed if caught, the writers failed to understand the Star Wars Universe and the personalities/principles of its characters. The episodes were repetitive and did not add anything to the Star Wars Universe. Moreover, they severely damaged the character of Obi-Wan Kenobi by removing his intelligence, principles and stoicism. From the Clone Wars tv show where Kenobi undergoes a complete physical transformation to hide his identity to this series having Obi-Wan one gust away from being revealed as a Jedi by having his lightsaber in full view or not even bothering to put his hood up while loudly saying the word \"Jedi\" as he's being hunted by a city of people with his photograph, the writers demonstrated that they did not understand nor care to understand Obi-Wan's character. And that's not to mention the scene where Obi-Wan poorly attempts to hide someone under a trench coat. However, the worst offence was in putting blood on Obi-Wan's hands by making him responsible for all of the death and suffering caused by Vader from episode 6 of this series on. The writers clearly did not care to learn and respect the prior development of Obi-Wan's character that showed that he is capable of putting aside his ego/personal feelings to do what ought to be done to serve the light side of the Force.  The writers choosing to have Obi-Wan retreat from the Force also makes no sense as he has one job which is to protect then train Luke Skywalker: what was his plan for protecting Luke? To throw sand and rocks at anyone who tried to harm/kill him? There were also a number of poor performances from a number of actors/actresses in lead roles in the show, and the cinematography was poor. It was a poorly developed and poorly executed concept-it's clear that this was an effort of quantity over quality to push out more Star Wars content as opposed to telling a good story that forms part of a coherent and continuous whole of the Star Wars universe canon. Give it a miss and re-watch the original trilogy instead or give the infinitely better Clone Wars tv show a chance.\n",

James Gunn perfectly weaves his sharp sense of humor into a narrative filled with sadness, anger, fear, hate, love and joy, that will not only keep viewers engaged in the story, but also in the characters who evolve and grow as they interact with one another. My only complaint is that he killed off ones that I would have loved to see in future episodes.\n",

      "Review: So finally they stop all the prequels and alternative universes and move Star Trek forward into the future for the first time in two decades! But... it's a letdown. 1) The push of the political agenda just keeps getting worse. 97% of the world is heterosexual but the show only allows the captain to have a heterosexual relationship while the show seems obsessed with representing every part of the LBGQT+ spectrum. Star Trek has always been progressive, and it would be okay to do that if done organically, but's it's never organic. It's always done in a way that's disruptive to the plot. 2) You're in the future but you haven't done anything interesting with Starships and technology, and you've actually undercut what many fans love. Detachable nacelles? Programmable matter? Site to site transporters so we can cut out walking to rush to more monologues? Where are the larger faster ships of the future? 3) Enough with the main character monologues where she cries and explains why the universe has to be focused on her and why she must make a painful sacrifice to save the day! 4) Develop other characters! Everyone wants to know more about the bridge crew. Everyone wants to know more about Owo and Detmer, but knowing this series, if they did develop them, they would just force them into a relationship with each other. It just feels like this show is wasting being in the future to focus on things that make for an incoherent and boring plot. I hope it's ultimately not considered canon and we can get a real Start Trek series set in the future.\n",

      "Building upon the dystopian, poorly-written mess of Season 1, Stat Trek Picard continues to feel like something churned out by writers whose only familiarity with The Next Generation and subsequent feature films comes from reading Wikipedia entries. This is hollow, predictable, loud, and seriously dumbed down entertainment from a franchise that used to be insightful, moving, and exciting.\n",
      "Where to start.\n",
      "The characters seem to have done all of their bonding offscreen, as nothing in Season 1 warrants how any of them behave towards one another now. Actors who we've seen shine in other roles are given bland, empty dialogue that was either cobbled together from an army of chimpanzees at typewriters or slightly talented 8th graders who think their work is far better than it actually is.\n",
      "It's disheartening to see drivel like this and Discovery earn high praise from critics, as real audiences will tell you this is a chore to slog through. If you truly loved TNG and the character of Picard, go no further. While Season 1 turned him into a bumbling apology monkey, routinely being barked at by what passes for strong female characters in modern Trek, Season 2 features an android walking around with Picard's memories in its head. An android body that, unlike Data's, seems to offer no added benefits. Does this Picard have an OFF switch? Do the writers even know Data had one? Probably not when you consider they think you can clone an android from a single positron. It's this level of deep stupidity that hampers the series from being anything but a nostalgic cash grab, and one that's not even been done very well.\n",

These scenes are a little heavy-handed and while the sets and costumes are great, it feels too static at times. On the other hand, there are also many scenes that are really engaging. This includes almost all of the action scenes and while some of the slower scenes drag in my opinion, there are also many with plenty of heart, drama and atmosphere.\n",

We also see her transform from a young lady to a young adult along with the sign of the times with her fashionable clothing that you would want to wear today.

Only for the rest of the season to break my heart. Such a letdown. Such an insult. Such a disappointment. And it's not even about not following the saga's events, the plot created by the show's writers was just eye rolling and illogical on so many levels. With so many aspects contradicting each other. \n",

      " I've loved these characters for so long that it so was painful to see how they and their relations with each other were mispresented in the show, how out of character majority of them felt. With Yennefer being the primary example. Anya Chalotra is a fantastic actress and it's not her fault that her Yen doesn't feel like Yen at all. I could see this in S1 already, where she behaved like a high school immature girl for most part, but I hoped it would change in s2. This time it's even worse. There are moments where we see that Anya could deliver the real Yen but sadly it's all up to the script which is terrible and characters are poorly written. Her first meeting with Ciri is just heart-breaking and loses touch of what the books conveyed (there's an excellent article on polygon.com which explains it perfectly).\n",

And Rience being able to teleport into Kear Morhen? And prostitutes at Kaer Morhen?? -  for the sake of some boobs on screen I suppose??? You may say that it's an adaptation and it doesn't have to be exactly as in the books which is a fair point but then why would you have Geralt telling Ciri that witchers like to stay low and hidden from the world? \n",

      "I liked quite a lot of things about this season though. The 1st episode (comparing to the episodes that followed, seemed like it was written by completely different people *cough* Sapkowski *cough cough*) Henry is fantastic as usual. So is Joey as Jaskier and my new favourite song \"Burn Butcher Burn\" (however the soundtrack in general seemed to have been lacking something and I prefer music from S1). Every single actor deserves praise as they did their very best with the scripts they were given. Visuals and CGI and general aesthetics were outstanding. I loved the little nods to fans of the games (it's funny as I'm not a gamer but I started playing Witcher 3 after watching season 1 of the Netflix show because I loved it and I craved more of witcher content. And after watching season 2 I started playing Witcher 2 because I needed sth to remind me about how good witcher stuff can be if done properly).  Unfortunately, all this is not enough for me to give this season more than 1 star since the negative aspects outweigh the good ones. Such a shame.\n",

You can tell that she's read the books, she knows the saga in details,  and I really want to believe that her heart is in the right place.  But some very bad,  risky decisions have been taken this season.  Some very lazy writing has been commited. Something went terribly wrong.  I greatly appreciate that Lauren doesn't shy away from fans' criticism and is willing to answer questions, engage in heated discussions and admit where things went wrong (which happened with s1). This is refreshing and I hope it continues. But recently I've seen her replying to some unfavourable comments with \"but other people loved it\" and I only hope it's because Xmas rush and she will take this massive criticism to heart and remember it when filming next seasons. \n",

When you take the books into consideration, recognizing how much potential an adaptation of them had, then the scale is easily tipped from mediocre to absolutely horrible -- pretty much every character and plotline was ruined to variable extents, with changes being made almost exclusively for the worst -- so you might (if your standards aren't that high and you lack the knowledge of the source material) be able to enjoy it, but once you understand how better it could've been or even just try to observe it more critically overall, it's almost impossible to sit through it -- it really felt like some kind of torture, since I found myself cringing throughout whole episodes (the only reason I kept going was to be able to give fair criticism).\n",

The game isn't completely accurate but it does the characters justice and it deserves it's high rating.\n",

I actually liked how it was as did my fiance and we kept track quite well.

Have Geralt make difficult decisions in these. Use these as Ciris training with Geralt. You can write these and have an impact in them, link them to the story. This is how you get your writing in, don't destroy previously created characters. \n",

      "\n",
      "We will start with Eskel who acts like a complete asshole in this. He is a character who helps a good bit with the Wild Hunt but isn't around too often. He's a pretty competent Witcher and seems a generally quiet but capable. In this, he invites a bunch of hookers to Kaer Morhen for a hooker party? No Witcher would do this...ever. he also messed up fighting a leshy, then you kill him?? Really? On top of which he threatens Ciri numerous times and tries to hit Geralt. You try creating drama out of nothing. Then when they hunt the leshy that killed him, it dies to a monster straight away that also dies almost immediately. 0 pay off and you could have easily not killed him, but wounded him and this all would have had the same effect. This is disgraceful writing.\n",
      " Ciri doesn't train at all with Geralt. She trains for about a day from what we see by Lambert and Coen (who is from the Griffin school, not the Wolf school if I'm correct). She then does 0 training with Triss and desperately tries to become a Witcher. This isn't right at all. Then she goes with Yen, gets possessed by a demon and kills almost all the Witchers and it's found out that the leshy that killed Eskel was her fault too. None of any of this happens. She trains with Geralt, proper fucking training!!!  She trains a bit with Triss and trains with Yen. She isn't responsible for almost wiping out the Witchers ffs. This is again bad writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Triss is probably one of the less destroyed characters however her involvement in getting Ciri to create witcher potions isn't very good. This whole thing is fabricated, it's not how they're made and even if Ciri consented to this, Triss would not help. Also the forcing of the romance without bringing in the real context of the relationship between Geralt and Triss is quite poorly done. you leave this and other things to be done with throwaway lines which is poor. People watching for the first time myst be left scratching their heads at this while me, knowing their relationship, I thought it was hammed up and tacky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yen, poor Yen. She loses her powers, is manipulated by a witch, lies to Ciri, kidnaps Ciri, lies to Geralt too, almost brings Ciri to a demon and is responsible for Ciri being possessed and for Ciri killing most of the Witchers. Absolutely none of this happens in the books or games. Yen loves Ciri and Geralt and protects Ciri no matter what. Yen would never behave like this and this level of writing is shambolic. \n",

That is absurd.\n",

Teaching from experience and guiding to the best path. Instead in this he pushes people to try to get the witcher serum made, is on board with just making Ciri a Witcher because she is fine with it, regardless of consequences, is happy to let hookers into Kaer Morhen and is generally a dislikeable twat in this series. He would do none of this! He doesn't want to make more Witchers nor would he sacrifice Ciri to do so behind Geralts back. In the show you the  have him mope about regretting the decision he would never make. \n",

      "Gods, I am angry but tired now after this. The actors did a fine job mostly but the writers and directors of this show should be ashamed of themselves. I honestly hope this rating goes down because it doesn't deserve a 76. Graphically it was good too. Also, I need to point out how far away Kaer Morhen is from Cintra. They're on opposite sides almost  so how can Geralt on Roach not catch up to Ciri when she was possessed? Also how are they all traveling so fast. Also when possessed, why doesn't the demon in Ciri use a portal to get to Kaer Morhen. Also how long does winter last because the Witchers seem to always be in Kaer Morhen. Also how does Ciri sneak up on the witchers? Their necklaces are just for show now? Shouldn't they have also detected Eskels leshy? How can Ciri sneak up on witchers and one shot them with a knife. They have incredible senses even when asleep and are quite durable. \n",

      "Review: As the first three episodes are the only ones yet released, my review is based on them. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am sold on this series. The show excellently portrays a complex set of relationships framed through a dissociative condition arising out of some combination of trauma and manipulation. It seems as if the writers, taking Wanda's depression and pain seriously, considered how a telepathic reality-warping mutant might experience a dissociative event, and in doing so makes Wanda Maximoff both a sympathetic character (she has lost her most intimate relationships due to Ultron and Thanos, she died to Thanos's snap only to come back and fight again, etc.), but is also a manipulative person who entangles others into her world and effectively uses her powers to gas-light and control others (some of whom we now know exist beyond the confinements of the neighborhood). While all of this is thematically \"heavy,\" the show is written simply enough to not have to psychoanalyze things to appreciate it, being slightly more involved than a typical MCU film, but no more complicated than some of Pixar's recent films. \n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest criticisms for the series so far are that every episode annoyingly ends with a 6-7 minute long credit sequence and that the theme song vocals have been mixed quite low. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, while I do think there might be some subjective criticisms of the show (everyone has their own tastes), it does seem that most negative reviews for this show generally follow two main misunderstandings. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, they reflect beliefs that WandaVision is an earnest take on classic sitcoms across the decades, or that the humor is supposed to be as funny or witty as the original shows. It seems that many of these viewers are not understanding that the failure of jokes landing the right way seems to be intentional. WandaVision is not an MCU based sitcom series (which most, but not all, criticisms form this category seem to get); it is loosely a psychological thriller with a comic-book twist wherein folks are trapped in Wanda Maximoff's alternate reality--for some mysterious and as-of-yet unknown reason--that bears the façade of these sitcoms. However, even those that recognize this isn't an MCU sitcom still expect it to function as one in terms of humor and writing. The fact of the matter is that the awkwardness with some of the humor is all part of the \"act\" of this strange reality following the classical form of irony known as \"paralipsis.\" This is not to say one must identify it as such to \"get it,\" but that misreading the misses as accidental reveals one as reading these jokes as earnest when the fact that they are not earnest attempts at writing witticisms is the point: it isn't a sitcom, but a delusion somewhat following the form and decorum of sitcoms. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, Many reviewers seem to think there is no meaning or point to the series because these episodes either do not make sense or are going nowhere. They, too, seem to misunderstand that this series seems to be structured such that the first few episodes are setting up the eventual conflict. This series-is a \"slow burn\" psychological thriller relative to typical MCU media, and the pace seems to be ready to pick up after the event with Geraldine.\n",

So much buildup to red herrings, a complete waste of Evans which could have meant anything in the multiverse and brought the X-men together with the avengers (probably a wet dream for most comic fans), and Agatha Harkness being the main villain felt like just Disneyfying the Marvel franchise. I can see why Disney chose to drag this out week by week, with episodes where the credits are almost longer than the content. Bingewatching this wouldn't exactly have inspired confidence to stick to your monthly subscription.

The first half of the series feels stretched out, I think this show would have benefited from being a few episodes shorter. The character of Laurie Blake in my opinion didn't work very well, Jean Smart gives a good performance but I personally felt the show dragged when it focused too much on her character, everything surrounding Laurie just didn't feel necessary for the overall plot and I felt they just forced her into the series since she was one of the main characters in the original comic. Not all of the mysteries in the series work but majority of them had me really intrigued to see how they would end. The show can be a little heavy handed at times but honestly so was the comic book, in the regard it's pretty faithful. Over it's a great series, I just wish it had been a little tighter because it's certainly slow at times during the first half of the series 7.5/10\n",

If Captain Carter or any of the other Guardians of the Multiverse transfer to live-action I might change my mind on the pointless bit, but it was still an extremely mediocre show. The fact it took up 2-3 months of this years Marvel content makes it even worse. Can't wait to get back to more live-action tv shows.\n",
