4,Mare of Easttown,1,"Performances in which madness, psychopathy or extreme pathos prevails usually are the ones who are most acclaimed. However, Winslet manages to give depth and authenticity to a much more mundane, but usually more banally represented feeling: tiredness.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127

10,Mare of Easttown,1,Ingelsby's unflinching study of character and Winslet's immaculate acting come together to achieve a kind of devastating perfection.,HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
11,Mare of Easttown,1,"All of this rich backstory and careful character detail significantly enhances the girl-murdered-in-a-small-town TV series template, already well explored by Sharp Objects and Top of the Lake.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
12,Mare of Easttown,1,"While the pacing of ""Mare"" is a little jarring out of the gate, it's ultimately what makes the show stand out from the rest of its ilk. It's as equally interested in the people on screen as it is in the gruesome fate that befalls one of them.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
13,Mare of Easttown,1,"What makes it worth seeing are the little things in the margins, and the scenes that burrow into Mare's daily life and lingering grief.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
14,Mare of Easttown,1,"If you can get past the melancholy and conventional plot, though, the series is thoroughly engaging.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
15,Mare of Easttown,1,"""Mare"" isn't just a Winslet acting exhibition, nor is it ever in danger of becoming a hollow A-list actor offensive... It's a riveting and messy family drama that's wrapped in a chewy and thrilling murder mystery.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127

19,Mare of Easttown,1,"It's the perfect show for anyone who loved to bathe in the unsparing pain of shows like Broadchurch and Sharp Objects, and it will no doubt be equally awarded during this year's Emmy telecast.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
20,Mare of Easttown,1,"Verisimilitude on its own can seem clinical; in Mare of Easttown, it is counterbalanced with a finely tuned emotional realism, as if the series' relationships had been buffed until they felt sufficiently timeworn as well.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127

22,Mare of Easttown,1,"Like any other thriller, the incredible Kate Winslet makes sure you are on the edge of the seat at the end of every single episode.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
23,Mare of Easttown,1,The challenge facing cop television now is the challenge to depict a desire for greater accountability in a profession notoriously hostile to it. Mare of Easttown doesn't face that challenge because its protagonist is consumed by accountability.,HBO MAX,95%,94%,127

26,Mare of Easttown,1,"While nobody will turn to the show for light relief, they might well turn to it for other reasons: the increasingly effective slow-burn plotting, the convincing nature of that small-town bleakness and, above all, Winslet's performance.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127

29,Mare of Easttown,1,"The white working class is depicted fairly, neither spitefully nor satirically. There is, in short, no Chetwyndian ""real enemy"" pulling strings behind the curtain, no groaner of a sociopolitical point being made. It's just a potboiler. Refreshing!",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127

35,Mare of Easttown,1,"It was a slice of perfection, a love letter to post-industrial Pennsylvania, face ground into the gutter and not even daring to look at the stars.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
36,Mare of Easttown,1,"The show is steeped in the classic hard-boiled world of good old-fashioned policing. But it is the characters we care about, even though they appear deficient when displaying emotion.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127

46,Mare of Easttown,1,"The mystery of who killed Erin McMenamin gave the show its plot, but over the course of seven episodes, it became clear that the series was most interested in exploring the contradictions and conundrums of motherhood.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
47,Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare of Easttown worked because of everything it wasn't: it wasn't a glossy book to TV adaptation, aka Big Little Lies, and it wasn't wig and coat acting, aka The Undoing. It was rooted firmly in the believably domestic.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
48,Mare of Easttown,1,"The show is equally drab and riveting, claustrophobic and caustic.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127

52,Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare of Easttown explores the repression of the American male of a certain class and race, with little fetishizing.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
53,Mare of Easttown,1,"HBO's Mare of Easttown is constructed around a familiar, virtually surefire plot: a shocking crime in a small town leads to an investigation that ultimately reveals every major local scandal in an astoundingly errant community. And it works.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
54,Mare of Easttown,1,"Kate Winslet may be the star, but it's the ensemble here that makes her new murder mystery series stand out from those that are pure logic puzzles or that focus strictly on killers or detectives.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127

56,Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare of Easttown might be confined by its played-out genre, but it also provides new turns on a familiar song.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
57,Mare of Easttown,1,"The plot gets going and Winslet makes the most of a role that in lesser hands could be a collection of tropes (in episode two, grouchy Mare is paired with a hotshot young detective brought in from out-of-town).",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
58,Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare Of Easttown is, more than anything else, a tour de force for its star, Kate Winslet, who owns this series, top to bottom.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
59,Mare of Easttown,1,"Every good murder mystery must feature a range of viable suspects, and Mare of Easttown does a great job of establishing a handful of red herrings both expected and not.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
60,Mare of Easttown,1,"Winslet is utterly mesmeric, shorn of any glamour, make-up-free and permanently sour-faced, dressed in a shapeless lumberjack shirt that does her no favours at all and looks as if it needs a boil wash.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
61,Mare of Easttown,1,"As the twists and turns of the cases are revealed, it becomes a show greater than the sum of its already considerable parts",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
62,Mare of Easttown,1,"It is a performance that will undoubtedly get [Kate Winslet] awards season recognition next year, a circuit that is familiar ground for her. But great work never gets old.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
63,Mare of Easttown,1,"For a work about a neglected corner of America, there's none of the sneering critique of Hillbilly Elegy or the ludicrous rivalries of Ozark. Instead, Mare of Easttown is just a subtle, textured portrait of a place where some people are suffering.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
64,Mare of Easttown,1,"I like Winslet's performance. Its fearlessness might be predictable -- doesn't every actor long to look this bad, while sounding this good? -- but her pugnacious attention to detail makes it very enjoyable to watch.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127

68,Mare of Easttown,1,"Without Winslet, Mare of Easttown's first episode is just another entry in a long list of high-profile crime dramas. Winslet makes it a compelling character study that I'm looking forward to unpacking over the next 6 weeks.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
69,Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare of Easttown wallows, but it takes its wallowing seriously. It's a cunningly crafted mystery series, anchored by an awesome Kate Winslet performance, that manages to evade most cliches.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
70,Mare of Easttown,1,"We've probably seen enough of this particular type of story that we can't get truly excited over these conventions anymore, but Mare of Easttown's direction is sharp, its writing is observant, and its star is giving yet another fantastic performance.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
71,Mare of Easttown,1,"New from HBO, Mare of Easttown is a fine addition to this lineage, thanks to a superb and surprising lead performance from Kate Winslet and excellent work from the show's writer and creator Brad Ingelsby.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127

73,Mare of Easttown,1,"In its rock-solid sense of place, though, Mare of Easttown sticks to at least one infallible rule: Inglesby is clearly writing what he knows...",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
74,Mare of Easttown,1,"Ingelsby has crafted a terrific character study that's even better as a slow-burning thriller, with the tone of a moody British mystery transplanted to the Northeast.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
75,Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare of Easttown is designed to be a limited series, so the self-contained aspect helps heighten both the character development and mystery-driven aspects of the series.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
76,Mare of Easttown,1,"It's both moody and atmospheric like the slow-burning Top of the Lake or True Detective, while being as propulsive as a Dan Brown paperback. By taking the best elements of both and dumping the rest, Mare of Easttown is unstoppable.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127

78,Mare of Easttown,1,Has the makings of a great HBO mystery series.,HBO MAX,95%,94%,127

80,Mare of Easttown,1,"Kate Winslet bares herself of all the glamour and movie star glitz to portray this woman. When she accepted this role, she checked her vanity at the door.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
81,Mare of Easttown,1,Easttown is not an ideal place. Mare is not an ideal detective or mom. But both have something more compelling than perfection going for them: they're real.,HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
82,Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare of Easttown is not the standard police procedural it seems, with more shocking twists and, thanks to Winslet's performance, empathy for grief than you might expect.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
83,Mare of Easttown,1,"Kate Winslet adds to a long list of magnificent, disappear-into-the-character performances as Mare Sheehan...",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127

86,Mare of Easttown,1,"Seriously, I hope Mare Of Easttown returns for some more cases. I probably wouldn't want to live in Easttown. But it's a great place to visit on my TV.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
87,Mare of Easttown,1,Mare of Easttown is the rare crime drama that has actually taken the best lessons from the genre and put them into action.,HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
88,Mare of Easttown,1,"Winslet never falters, making ""Easttown"" seem like the place she was born, raised and disappointed. Peters and Smart are great sparring partners but Mare is the deserving main attraction. Winslet is the reason.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
89,Mare of Easttown,1,"Elements of ""Mare"" do feel overly familiar, particularly the hard-charging-woman- detective-who's-dedicated-to-the-job-at-the-expense-of-her-family trope. But it's easy to forgive thanks to Winslet's performance and the show's strong supporting cast.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
90,Mare of Easttown,1,A seven-part series whose powers derive as much from its enthralling focus on that town and its society as from the unsteady life and career of its heroine... Kate Winslet's eloquent command of the role is obvious from the outset.,HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
91,Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare's courage at confronting the demons of this town offer up a particularly satisfying kind of catharsis, where women paying attention to each other can save each other from the worst kind of bogeyman.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
92,Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare of Easttown ultimately yields a better production than the description probably sounds -- proof that with this sort of endeavor, it's not always so much about the ingredients as how you put them together.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
93,Mare of Easttown,1,"The acting -- by Winslet and the strong ensemble around her -- is compelling enough to make it all feel more tragic than soapy, more complex than overcooked.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
94,Mare of Easttown,1,"It's a fully rounded portrait of a town, with a female figure at its centre. And Winslet holds it all together with a quietly commanding, note-perfect performance.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
95,Mare of Easttown,1,"Very cool character. Interesting, and further proof of Winslet's extraordinary versatility.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
96,Mare of Easttown,1,"It is impossible here not to mention Jean Smart as Helen, Mare's mother, and if you thought there was no conceivable way that the star of everything from Designing Women to Fargo would be anything but fantastic, you were right.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
97,Mare of Easttown,1,"Its characters are deeply real and expertly drawn, its sense of place firmly established and specific, and its clues genuinely shocking. It's an intense and satisfying to watch, going to places your average murder mystery wouldn't aspire.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
98,Mare of Easttown,1,"Ingelsby and Zobel display an appealingly old-fashioned dedication to characterization and world-building, creating a town where many of the residents have working-class backgrounds.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
99,Mare of Easttown,1,"Wearing her Pennsylvanian American accent, Winslet makes you believe in Mare as a person and not a part; the actress, who spends much of the opening episode limping, does not mind looking bedraggled, and you can feel the world weighing on her.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
100,Mare of Easttown,1,"Thus is the power of a great cast (courtesy of casting director Avy Kaufman) given a meticulous world to play in; credit to Ingelsby, who grew up in the area, and Zobel, for knowing what details to hone in on without overindulging.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
101,Mare of Easttown,1,"A brilliant, bitterly funny Kate Winslet digs deep as a small-town, Pennsylvania detective in HBO's compulsively watchable crime series that is full of twists you won't see coming. Emmy attention must be paid.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
102,Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare of Easttown is a pleasure to watch, with everyone in Mare's orbit, and vice versa, as she circles in on the show's main mystery.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127

105,Mare of Easttown,1,I am invested in finding out Who Did It. Just know that the mystery moves at a glacial pace. The material strains for twisted Opioid Gothic social resonance.,HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
106,Mare of Easttown,0,"Winslet elevates everything, but ""Mare of Easttown"" needs some serious elevating out of its dreariness and familiarity. It's certainly watchable but also predictable. Look elsewhere for light.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
107,Mare of Easttown,0,"It's nice that HBO has turned out another handsomely produced, manifestly serious mini-series for the wonderful actress Kate Winslet. It would be nicer if those series were worth her time and talent.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
108,Mare of Easttown,1,"Every performance here works, which is a great credit to Zobel for tying these characters together in a way that makes the supporting players seem like actual locals with full lives.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
109,Mare of Easttown,1,"Great acting can be contagious, and here it's tucked into every dark corner and secret. You don't just watch ""Mare of Easttown."" You live in its shadows.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
110,Mare of Easttown,1,"If Winslet doesn't likewise figure in awards contention for this role I'll be astonished. She is absolutely superb - by turns funny, fierce and infuriating -- in what surely counts as an acting masterclass.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
111,Mare of Easttown,1,The series leaves no police procedural cliché untouched but ultimately transcends its familiarity.,HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
112,Mare of Easttown,1,"Even though the performances, direction, and other technical aspects of the show are top-notch, it's a tough watch whose early to middle chapters don't provide the kind of emotional catharsis that justifies all the hardship.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
113,Mare of Easttown,1,"""Mare of Easttown"" isn't the feel-good show of the spring season, and is dark, dirty, and depressing, but its soulfulness offers an unmistakable sentiment of hope that's hard to combat.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
114,Mare of Easttown,1,"Even if it were just a basic crime drama, Mare of Easttown would be pretty good... But this seven-episode saga is more than just a gasp-inducer.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
115,Mare of Easttown,1,It's the perfect mix of genre and drama and an exemplary encapsulation of why the prestige limited series might be the best format for adult storytelling we have right now.,HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
116,Mare of Easttown,0,"More than halfway through the series, there's barely any momentum to the mystery, and the relationship drama is sprawling and unfocused.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
117,Mare of Easttown,1,"Winslet is fantastic as Mare. If you ever thought that the actress would be great as a fearless yet somewhat closed-off detective solving murders, you're absolutely correct.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
118,Mare of Easttown,1,"Although the tormented cop trope is hardly new, the show's opening episodes are utterly absorbing, cleverly drawing us into the central mystery and into the sprawling ensemble's tangled personal lives, which are equally, if not more compelling.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
119,Mare of Easttown,1,"At its best the series gives Winslet space to deliver a performance that resists fireworks in favor of flickering doubts, insecurities and concerns... Soon, you'll be most closely watching her when she's doing a million things silently.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
120,Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare sets the scene so vividly that the murder mystery almost isn't even necessary. These characters, and this town, are enough to command our attention.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
121,Mare of Easttown,1,"Whatever happens in the episodes to come, at its heart Mare of Easttown is the story of a fierce, ordinary heroine, beautifully played. No fright wigs, no prosthetics. No need.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
122,Mare of Easttown,1,"For all its unevenness, Mare of Easttown's strengths carry it through its many muddles.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
123,Mare of Easttown,1,"Winslet is in stunning form as the put upon but never downtrodden cop and matriarch, and it's a role which suits her amazing ability to simultaneously dominate the screen with a character.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
124,Mare of Easttown,1,"It's commendably ambitious but the plot elements sometimes work against each other - too baggy to be a compelling crime thriller, too busy to flesh out all the characters - to make it truly satisfying.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127
125,Mare of Easttown,1,"""I know you're worth saving,"" a character tells Mare at one of her lowest points. We should all be lucky enough to have someone say those words to us someday.",HBO MAX,95%,94%,127

127,Westworld,1,"I have no idea what is going on, but now in the good, excited way that reminds me of seasons one and two rather than the listless, can’t-be-arsed way of season three. Which, I would say, is déjà vu to be welcomed. Fingers crossed.",HBO MAX,81%,74%,30
128,Westworld,1,"It’s an absolute smorgasbord of thespian delights. Even at its most opaque, Westworld has always been worth watching just for those performances.",HBO MAX,81%,74%,30
129,Westworld,1,"Westworld has returned in assured and brilliant style... Just when you think you have a handle on what’s happening, a big twist shows that you don’t.",HBO MAX,81%,74%,30

135,Westworld,0,"While there is surely intelligent life out there eager to see where this goes, at this point it's not so much a question of not being able to follow the series through its convoluted maze as simply not feeling as if it's worth the energy to try.",HBO MAX,81%,74%,30
136,Westworld,1,"At this point, you sort of have to admire Westworld's resistance to crowd pleasing. We're so far beyond the lauded robot cowboy show at this point, I've swerved back around into begrudgingly respecting the Nolans' absurdly complicated narrative.",HBO MAX,81%,74%,30

139,Westworld,1,One may miss the intriguing narrative loops and interior fugues of seasons one and two... But there is nonetheless shivery fun to be had as Westworld imagines what was probably the inevitable outcome of all this tinkering with synthetic thought.,HBO MAX,81%,74%,30

151,Westworld,1,"You may be wondering if you’ll need a refresher before tackling this new batch of episodes, but I was surprised at how easy to follow the show was — even if it had been more than two years since I last saw Maeve, Dolores and the destruction of Rehoboam.",HBO MAX,81%,74%,30

166,Irma Vep,1,"It's all very clever and very much inside baseball, and there are times when it's almost exhausting keeping up with all the byzantine developments, but Irma Vep is worth the effort for its many moments of inspired lunacy.",HBO MAX,100%,60%,36
167,Irma Vep,1,"Irma Vep was already a deeply meta story. Adapting it into an HBO series starring Alicia Vikander risks losing the plot entirely—but as it turns out, the director still has plenty to say about Hollywood.",HBO MAX,100%,60%,36

191,Irma Vep,1,“Irma Vep” certainly leans into a more exclusive conversation about art — likely too elusive for mainstream audiences — but that lively discussion will be delectable for those in the know.,HBO MAX,100%,60%,36
192,Irma Vep,1,"Everything is built around Vikander, in a role that makes expert use of the star’s ballet-trained physicality. There’s a palpable eroticism to her scenes with Arjona... but mostly the performance is just wonderfully light and open.",HBO MAX,100%,60%,36

201,Barry,1,"While previous seasons asked if it was possible to change, or if Barry is doomed to a life of violence, this season is firmly dealing with consequences.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
202,Barry,1,Barry has always expertly balanced its tragicomedy demands so that even the funniest moments are laced with sadness while exploiting the absurd in the gloom. It’s a precarious tension but Hader and Berg have mastered it.,HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
203,Barry,1,"This season is something close to a masterpiece in its meticulous set pieces and sun-washed cinematography, in its stunts and action sequences, and in deepening emotional stakes.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51

205,Barry,1,Barry is one of the tightest shows out there. Not a moment is wasted.,HBO MAX,99%,89%,51

208,Barry,1,"Three years and a pandemic has done nothing to dull the edges of Barry or Bill Hader’s funny and sometimes frightening performance, and Winkler and the rest of the cast are still at the top of their games in the third season.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
209,Barry,1,"Frankly, the averageness of all these people -- and all people -- is the crux of the show's sublime one-two punch of tragedy and giggles.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
210,Barry,1,"Hader, believably shifting moods from catatonic to manic, makes Barry someone to fear and also, despite ourselves, to cheer. He belongs in the pantheon with Walter White and Dexter Morgan. Simply put, Barry slays me.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
211,Barry,1,"Comedy lets Barry’s writers and performers deftly field all of these complex feelings, the fact that violence is abhorrent and yet compelling to watch, without feeling like it’s moralizing. Every squirm comes with an equally big laugh.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
212,Barry,1,"Delving deeper into Hollywood's quirks and its title character's double life, the crackling third season continues to operate like a high-wire act without a net.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51

214,Barry,1,"Mostly, the season opens as a cautionary tale about getting what you wish for. Much like the story of The Monkeys Paw, or Stephen Kings Pet Sematary, the things you thought you wanted may not turn out to be what they seemed. They may be way, way worse.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
215,Barry,1,This half-hour comedy is still one of television’s best suspense-filled thrillers.,HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
216,Barry,1,"A master class on how to move a story forward without losing the spark that ignited it in the first place, keeping the tone without compromising substance. Full review in Spanish",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
217,Barry,1,The series still has its trademark dark humor and self-deprecating inside Hollywood humility. The difference here is that all point points from previous seasons lead to a dark intensity while sacrificing a fair portion of comic relief.,HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
218,Barry,1,"Season 3 is every bit as high-octane, uproarious, and unhinged as ever — and the dark part of this dark comedy is slowly closing in.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
219,Barry,1,"The enthusiasm for acting which lit up Haders mobile features in the first two seasons is drained away. Hes now barely going through the motions of redemption. A show about faking it feels more fake, and therefore more true to itself than ever.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
220,Barry,1,"The show still somehow manages to accomplish the Herculean feat of topping itself, zigging when most shows would zag and finding new, creative ways to make you laugh out loud.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
221,Barry,1,"Barry more than justifies its existence as an ongoing series with a run of episodes that puts all of the show’s elements back in ridiculous, cruel harmony -- and in some cases go beyond anything Hader did in that immaculate first season.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51

224,Barry,1,"Even though we have waited three years for more episodes of Barry, it is absolutely worth it. While there are only eight episodes before we have to wait for more, these are the best chapters of this series yet.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
225,Barry,1,"Barry is simply a masterpiece of deeply humane, hilarious satire.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
226,Barry,1,"In Season 3, the comic drama gets as dark and morally knotty as Better Call Saul. Like Bob Odenkirk’s Saul, Hader’s Barry proves that an SNL funnyman can turn out to be one of the great dramatic actors on TV.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
227,Barry,1,"Season 3 goes darker than this show every has before as it is unafraid to deep dive into PTSD, abuse, violence, humanity, and forgiveness. Filled with incredibly powerful performances by all involved, this is the best season yet.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
228,Barry,1,"Among the many gifts Bill Hader delivers in this fabulous new chapter of his series is that, in picking off almost exactly where he left us, it feels almost as if the last two years never happened. How great is that?",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
229,Barry,1,"Still strange, dark, harrowing and often — unexpectedly — very funny.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
230,Barry,1,"After a nearly three-year absence, Barry returns darker and funnier than ever. Bill Hader’s reluctant hitman continues to find himself caught between a farce and horror, and the actor is a shoo-in for another Emmy nomination (and maybe win).",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
231,Barry,1,"In its long-awaited third season, iBarryi is as assured and morosely hilarious as ever.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51

234,Barry,1,"In Season 3, the show has fully outgrown its cutesy premise to become one of TV's best thrill rides.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
235,Barry,1,"Season three of Barry sees one of televisions most compelling, darkly comic series stepping back into the light with nary a beat skipped, finding new moral complications for its widening cast of characters without losing its offbeat sense of humor.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
236,Barry,1,"The shocking originality of Hader's performance in the first season can't be replicated, of course, but he manages to maintain the quality of it throughout.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
237,Barry,1,"It was good in its first two seasons and, I am pleased to report, it is still really good in its... third season. Maybe even better than ever.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
238,Barry,1,"It’s one of the most meaningful, and complicated, uses of dark comedy on television. It’s also hard to tell whether the dark or the comedy will win in the end, but that’s what keeps us watching.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
239,Barry,1,"A richer and deeper character study than “Barry” has previously been, and... a pleasing reward for fans who’ve waited nearly three years for more of this story.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51
240,Barry,1,"Where Barry or ""Barry"" goes next is an exciting, if trepidatious mystery. But both the man and the show are earning every step.",HBO MAX,99%,89%,51

252,The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"The series is never so engrossing that you forget about Clare and Henry’s interactions when she is a child. There is always that niggly feeling it’s not quite right, and the show doesn’t do enough to assuage that impression.",HBO MAX,38%,84%,40

419,The Staircase,1,"True crime has come a long way from the cheap, lurid days of America’s Most Wanted. The Staircase, starring Colin Firth and Toni Collette, has the posh cast and opulent production values that showcase the genre’s evolution.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99

431,The Staircase,1,There's a lot to like about this series.,HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
432,The Staircase,1,"As a whole, The Staircase is a worthwhile watch, mainly for the performances by Firth, Posey and Collette. But you might get more satisfying information about the Peterson case by watching the documentary or docuseries.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
433,The Staircase,1,The Staircase winds up being a meta-text more than a murder mystery --and it’s a riveting one.,HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
434,The Staircase,1,"Colin Firth plays Michael Peterson and does it with a rare kind of skill. If you think the case has been mined enough already, your mind is changed by Firth’s extraordinary subtlety as a man of many secrets and delusions.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99

436,The Staircase,1,"Colin Firth burns with intensity in this true-crime series that keeps you guessing if a bisexual novelist, politician, former marine and frequent liar pushed his wife (Toni Collette) to her death down the family staircase or whether she fell by accident.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
437,The Staircase,1,"If The Staircase (in all its iterations) embodies exploitative true crime trashiness, then I am its garbage disposal...",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99

447,The Staircase,1,"It’s also a reminder of the genius of Colin Firth, who, as Michael Peterson, is at the center of the show and holds it expertly. It’s a cliché to say that an actor disappears into his role, but there it is",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
448,The Staircase,1,"It’s a pro job. But if you’re interested in the facts behind the fact-based fiction, there is little new to learn.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99

456,The Staircase,0,"The problem is, in a good fictional crime story, the writers and directors feel a sense of responsibility to make you care. Here, there’s an underlying assumption that we’ll care, and that assumption leads to plodding, stultifying drama.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
457,The Staircase,1,"Though this drama tries and fails to reach the same heights as its predecessor, it nevertheless makes for gripping viewing.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
458,The Staircase,1,"The Staircase is intensely concerned with not just the mystery at hand, but with the mystery of all people, maybe all of life. Campos, who directed six episodes and ran the show with Maggie Cohn, fills the series with small and tantalizing detail.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
459,The Staircase,1,"It's not often that a dramatization of something that people already know about is told in such a nuanced way, but there truly is something for everyone here.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99

465,The Staircase,1,"Even as close as the documentary came in its pursuit of real answers, The Staircase doesn't offer much clarity beyond that, with no obvious answer amidst a legion of inscrutable mysteries that may never be unraveled.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
466,The Staircase,1,"It’s full of tricky, complicated ambiguities that are often riveting and sometimes just baffling... This is a series that seems to admit that a lot of true crime, or at least this one, is really a no-win slow descent into a tragic morass.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
467,The Staircase,1,"The linchpin of this delicate portrayal is Colin Firth’s performance as Michael. Best known for playing romantic leads and other charismatic types, he disappears, here, into a far murkier character.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
468,The Staircase,1,"It’s more than a “did he do it?” mystery; it’s an indictment of the vagaries of the criminal justice system, the narcissism of abusive men, and most of all, through Collette, it gives Kathleen some much-needed humanity.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
469,The Staircase,1,"Perhaps the focus of future chapters will be tighter, but as far as the premiere episodes are concerned, youd be better off watching the documentary series first, before chasing it with Firths acting masterclass.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
470,The Staircase,1,Colin Firth And Toni Collette Are Equally Strong In This Expansion Of The True Crime Saga.,HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
471,The Staircase,1,"An intriguing and captivating miniseries that dives deeper than the documentary did. Twists and surprises are around every corner for those who don't know the story, but those who do will enjoy it as well.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
472,The Staircase,1,"Seriously, get this watched.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99

474,The Staircase,1,"The Staircase functions best as a documentary looking intently on the shortcomings of the American legal system, and how things can become so convoluted and messy that both victims and the accused will never find justice, closure, or peace.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
475,The Staircase,1,"Most of us would like to think that, if we were in Michael Peterson's position, certain processes would be in place.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99

477,The Staircase,1,The sheer amount of archival footage in this show is absolutely nuts.,HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
478,The Staircase,1,It makes for very powerful TV.,HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
479,The Staircase,1,It's illuminating how flawed and nave the concept of blind justice is.,HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
480,The Staircase,1,"This rotating cast of vampires and misfits not only makes for a thrillingly sloppy and mad case, it creates extraordinary telly, all whittled down from 16 years of footage.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
481,The Staircase,1,"If The Staircase is a puzzle, it's one that still works no matter how you decide to arrange the pieces.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
482,The Staircase,1,Unmissable stuff.,HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
483,The Staircase,1,"It is a tragedy of epic proportions, sprawled out over 15 years. Days turn into weeks, weeks into months, months into years. The case drags on. Yet Kathleen Peterson remains dead, reduced to a series of graphic images, to pieces of bloody evidence.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
484,The Staircase,1,"Perhaps the greatest achievement of ""The Staircase""...is that you can watch all 13 episodes and ultimately still not be able to decide whether the protagonist, Michael Peterson, is guilty or innocent.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
485,The Staircase,1,Groundbreaking true crime documentary is still compelling.,HBO MAX,93%,77%,99

489,The Staircase,1,"The Staircase is like a true-crime version of the Up series, albeit on a much more modest scale. It is compelling, but like many entries in this genre, not exactly an objective work of journalism.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
490,The Staircase,1,"The one-sidedness does mean you never get any sense of Kathleen...and certain questions go unanswered...Still, it's 13 hours you won't mind never getting back.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
491,The Staircase,0,"To call The Staircase a docu-series is a gross exaggeration. It is filmed entirely from the perspective of Peterson's team, an overwrought exploration of a self-involved family.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
492,The Staircase,1,"There's a lot of waiting around, a lot of eavesdropping on the minutiae and small-talk of the legal system. But that offers its own insights.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99
493,The Staircase,1,"The Staircase leaves you with an understanding not of how righteous justice is, but how evasive for so many, and how the best investigative work is thorough and slow-like the documentary itself.",HBO MAX,93%,77%,99

504,The Flight Attendant,1,Cuoco’s Cassie remains a magnetic heroine forever on the precipice of calamity.,HBO MAX,91%,62%,45

511,The Flight Attendant,1,"Season two of “The Flight Attendant” doesn’t mix things up much from its first season. While fans will delight that all the twists and turns are back, it’s hard to believe that Cassie never learned her lesson following her season one brush with death.",HBO MAX,91%,62%,45
512,The Flight Attendant,1,"The story is streamlined to focus more on Cassies personal development. This might turn off those who enjoyed what Season 1 laid out, but if youve enjoyed the characters this far youll continue to love Cuoco and company as they try to become adults.",HBO MAX,91%,62%,45
513,The Flight Attendant,1,"The first season of HBO Maxs The Flight Attendant was a harrowing, brutal exploration of trauma and addiction. Season two, in contrast, after two episodes, is a zany spy comedy.",HBO MAX,91%,62%,45

516,The Flight Attendant,1,The Flight Attendant still weaves humor and heartbreak into some pretty solid spy stuff.,HBO MAX,91%,62%,45
517,The Flight Attendant,1,"There's no denying the soaring pleasure of The Flight Attendant despite these minor irritations even so, because Cuoco is simply that good at captaining our way through Cassie's muchness.",HBO MAX,91%,62%,45
518,The Flight Attendant,1,"The result is a less tight whodunnit, but something that remains at its best when Cassie is complicating her own life, doubling down on mistakes while struggling to convince herself and everyone around her that she’s simply cruising.",HBO MAX,91%,62%,45

525,The Flight Attendant,1,"What this season excels at is Cuoco’s character work as Cassie -- not only as all the alternate versions of her in the mind palace, but also as the real-world version of her, who’s working through her trauma, addiction, and self-sabotaging tendencies.",HBO MAX,91%,62%,45
526,The Flight Attendant,0,"While everything was new to Cassie the first time around -- making her a sort of classic Hitchcockian Everywoman, way over her head in this world of espionage -- the mystery here proves more convoluted and difficult to track.",HBO MAX,91%,62%,45

531,The Flight Attendant,1,"Diving into the second season, though, provides a forceful reminder of just how good this show is at getting you inside the head of someone constantly on the edge of a panic attack.",HBO MAX,91%,62%,45
532,The Flight Attendant,1,The way Cuoco is able to calibrate her performance to perform with herself is nothing short of amazing.,HBO MAX,91%,62%,45

686,Succession,1,"Succession has quickly ascended to the type of series that ultimately defines a network, much like Game of Thrones and The Sopranos did for HBO years ago.",HBO MAX,94%,85%,93
687,Succession,1,"It's a slower burn than Season 2, but that merely opens up new avenues for our soulless antiheroes to twist in the wind, especially as the family civil war heats up.",HBO MAX,94%,85%,93
688,The Sopranos,1,"A show about everything, that meant something, that adds up to no specific conclusion, or realisation, or point of clarity. The wheel turns. The American Nightmare continues.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
689,The Sopranos,1,"The Sopranos is written with psychological depth and made with creative freedom. The result is personal, but not impenetrable or surly. [Full review in Spanish]",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
690,The Sopranos,1,"The Sopranos came up with an ending just as murky and disorienting as the 85 hours that led up to it. Rather than betray its ethos by bowing to convention, The Sopranos went out on its own terms.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
691,The Sopranos,1,"Who knows? We'll never know. And it's better that way. If you're thinking there's a movie in the works, think again. It was supposed to end like this.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
692,The Sopranos,1,"Any explanation... no matter how smart or well-reasoned, misses the point. To explain it would diminish it.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
693,The Sopranos,1,"Rather than an ending that would stop the conversation about Tony Soprano, Chase gave us an ending that will keep us talking.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
694,The Sopranos,1,"Chase isn't the only auteur to turn an audience's bloodlust against itself, but unlike, say, Michael Haneke or Quentin Tarantino, he chose an unnervingly quiet way to leave us on the hook, in perpetuity.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
695,The Sopranos,1,It's still a master-class in building tension. David Chase mines more suspense out of a family talking at a diner as a young woman struggles to parallel park than most pure horror directors could even dream.,HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
696,The Sopranos,0,"To me, it felt like an hourlong f--- you from a guy who has seen fan devotion for The Sopranos transform him from a little-known but well respected TV producer into one of the most legendary TV auteurs in history.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
697,The Sopranos,1,"[Creator David] Chase was true to himself, and that's what made The Sopranos brilliant on Sunday night, and the 85 episodes that went before.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
698,The Sopranos,1,"It's not TV, as HBO often reminded us. No, it was something on a much grander scale.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
699,The Sopranos,1,"There is some evidence to support the notion that Chase punk'd fans with mad, self-congratulatory glee... But I admire his zeal in defying expectation.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
700,The Sopranos,1,Chase played us like a grand piano.,HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
701,The Sopranos,1,"It felt more violent, more disturbing, more unfair than even the most savage murders Chase has depicted over the course of six seasons, because the victim was us. He ended the series by whacking the viewer.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
702,The Sopranos,1,"Its final season mostly crackled, with the usual superior performances and writing from actors James Gandolfini and Edie Falco, and creator David Chase... For now it's curtains on an extraordinary achievement.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
703,The Sopranos,0,"David Chase, after so much brilliant work... seemed to be saying he could take it or leave it. So he left it.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
704,The Sopranos,1,"Dark, funny, strange, a perfect way to begin this final examination of these characters' twisted psyches.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
705,The Sopranos,1,"And so, bada-bing, just like a whacking, The Sopranos was done. But the range and capability of TV drama was expanded forever.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
706,The Sopranos,1,"Chase had a grand time in his almost playful home stretch, offering a clue-strewn valedictory episode and a beautifully unresolved stopping point.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
707,The Sopranos,1,"Somehow, though, it feels like the perfect final note. Why wouldn't a show that's taken such pleasure in rewriting the rules of storytelling go out in the least conventional way possible?",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
708,The Sopranos,1,"All of the death foreshadowing the author finds throughout the series is present, and it steps up a notch in the final season.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31

711,The Sopranos,0,One can understand David Chase's desire to have a completely unique ending... But that doesn't mean we have to like it.,HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
712,The Sopranos,1,Mr. Chase wanted to end his tale without melodrama or even a splashy denouement. He succeeded.,HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
713,The Sopranos,1,"Think of it as complete at last, a perfect whole. It's finished but it's not over. Life goes on.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
714,The Sopranos,0,"For six seasons, the crime drama seemed worthy of being considered a work of art. But last night felt far too much like TV as usual with all its commercial compromises and unfulfilled promises.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31

716,The Sopranos,1,"If The Godfather: Part II offers a revisionist take on the 1950s American Dream, then The Sopranos is our elegy to that long-gone era of postwar affluence.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
717,The Sopranos,1,It may have been the greatest double-take -- by the audience -- in the history of American television.,HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
718,The Sopranos,1,"Each of the final episodes was anticipated not so much with pleasure as dread, since each posed the risk of an unacceptable loss, as characters in whom we had invested years of attention were swept away.",HBO MAX,92%,97%,31
719,The Wire,1,[Michael K.] Williams quietly dismantled preconceptions about masculinity and sexuality alike and became a hero and icon both on and off-screen. It's not his only great acting role.,HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
720,The Wire,1,"The Wire wasn't afraid to be gentle while laying out a bleaker truth for its viewers, delivering one of the more satisfying finales in television history.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
721,The Wire,1,It's far more satisfying than the dismal end to The Sopranos and it is noticeable that there is nothing that would prevent HBO from making another season of The Wire.,HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
722,The Wire,1,"Even if you came to series five cold, from a Wireless world, you'd have found plenty to enjoy: the way the dialogue is at once naturalistic and aphor-istic [and] the outstanding naturalism of the performances.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
723,The Wire,1,"Quite simply, it was the best television drama ever made, and if it's ever surpassed it won't be on this side of the Atlantic. British TV does not have the resources, the scriptwriters or the actors even to attempt something on this scale.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
724,The Wire,1,"The Wire amazes with its gritty attention to detail. It feels so damned real, and from Day One that's been both its blessing and its curse. You don't kick up your feet to watch. Nor do you feel at ease.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
725,The Wire,1,"The Wire is a programme that demands your full attention but eventually it repays you, and once it begins to weave its spell you'll find yourself, much like several of its characters, totally hooked and desperate for more.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
726,The Wire,1,"The Wire isn't the most accessible series. The show lays out a lot of plot strands, forcing the question: Where are we headed? Stick with it, though, and you'll see a remarkable tapestry.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
727,The Wire,1,"So much happened. At times it seemed too rushed, but ultimately it all came together as plots were hatched, schemes crumbled and truth and honesty took a major beating.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
728,The Wire,1,"The plots are labyrinthine and defy easy entry. The dialogue resonates with the lingua franca of the streets, so there's much that can't be accessed until viewers get used to the language.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
729,The Wire,1,The Wire avoids caricatures with pitch-perfect depictions of the criminals scrapping their way to the top of a bloody heap.,HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
730,The Wire,1,It's great to once again be in the company of these amazing actors... And it's a pleasure to be treated to amazing writing that doesn't try to simplify things and/or pander.,HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
731,The Wire,1,"This season, series creator David Simon has added an extra layer of interest by focusing on his newspaper roots. This season also is less complicated than past seasons.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
732,The Wire,1,"It's a tale less of crime and punishment than crime and survival... It all adds up to a message that requires a very precise rhythm, in script and performance, and from the first moments of this new season, The Wire is locked in.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
733,The Wire,1,"Led by a solid core of returning characters -- none true villains, none true heroes -- with important additions (and sad subtractions) each season, it's one of the best series of all time.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44

738,The Wire,1,I'm praying that [David Simon's] fury at the Sun won't overwhelm his genius for storytelling.,HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
739,The Wire,1,"Ultimately, the show doesn't even have a moustache-twirling villain. There are just people. David Simon and his brilliant cast and crew did everything in their power to depict these people are honestly and fairly as possible.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
740,The Wire,0,"Though interesting at times, the fictionalized account of The Baltimore Sun lacks the depth of the institutions depicted in seasons past.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
741,The Wire,1,"In a season filled with great performances, the menacing portrayal of Marlo Stanfield turned in by Hector is the best reason to watch season five.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
742,The Wire,1,"... if you're looking for new episodes of the best cop show on television, well, we won't say it. Enough is enough, right?",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
743,The Wire,1,"Creating a microcosm of a broken nation, The Wire remained, to the very last fade-out montage, as messy and often painful as life itself.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
744,The Wire,1,Among the many things that separate The Wire from other TV dramas is the way that creator David Simon eases into a season.,HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
745,The Wire,1,This episode quickly reminds us of how completely believable and engrossing the world Simon has created is. Every moment feels genuine.,HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
746,The Wire,1,"The dense mythology of HBO's The Wire, painstakingly created over five novelistic seasons, has enough drama packed inside to be easily spun out for the next five, ten, 15 years.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
747,The Wire,1,The show will go out as one of the medium's greatest.,HBO MAX,94%,97%,44

749,The Wire,1,"Some of the themes in The Wire may be generic (underpaid cops, newsroom politics), but the series achieves immense success in one vital regard for drama -- the feeling that we are in a real place.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
750,The Wire,1,"Based on the seven episodes previewed, it's every bit as cynical, riveting and brilliant as the four flights that preceded it -- a searing look at the decay of a major American city that puts most of what's on television to shame.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
751,The Wire,1,"It is as if, in a guilty fever, we dreamt up our own worst punishments-stories of the sort Joan Didion used to tell us about the princess caged in the consulate and the man with the candy leading the children into the sea.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
752,The Wire,1,"It is one of the most intimate and alarming depictions of urban America on television, and yet it's an invigorating and even exhilarating experience, each season a new Harry Potter book for adults.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
753,The Wire,1,The Wire certainly is Dickensian.,HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
754,The Wire,1,"The fifth and final season may be the most overtly farcical, but only because things in this slightly fictionalized Baltimore have become, if you can imagine, worse than ever. When the going gets tough on The Wire, the tough get funny.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
755,The Wire,1,Simon can rest assured that he's created something unique that will last well beyond the confines of its prime time ratings prison.,HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
756,The Wire,1,"If there's one problem with The Wire, it's that, five seasons in, too many beautifully realized characters fight for too little room - a gem of a complaint to have.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
757,The Wire,1,David Simon's sprawling epic of urban decay is as good as this startlingly brilliant show has ever been - and it has always been among TV's best.,HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
758,The Wire,1,"Not exactly a Hallmark card, but one hell of an artistic achievement.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
759,The Wire,1,Fans of the show will not likely be disappointed. This new 10-episode season boasts the same high quality of production that this series has always exhibited.,HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
760,The Wire,1,The odds are good that you have not yet watched the first four seasons of The Wire... and that means that I as TV critic have failed you. Mea culpa.,HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
761,The Wire,1,"Once again, Simon does the impossible. He takes themes we've heard a million times - our politicians are corrupt, our schools are failing our kids, our newspapers are being raped by corporate overlords - and he gracefully, subtly realizes them onscreen.",HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
762,The Wire,0,Simon so forces events in the improbable newspaper story line of an invented serial killer that he does serious damage to the credibility of the police drama.,HBO MAX,94%,97%,44
763,Station Eleven,1,"The ideal show for right now... a lyrical, heartfelt and character-driven apocalyptic musing with an immediate difference.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
764,Station Eleven,1,"Yet everything coheres brilliantly over time. The final result is one of the most emotionally engaging, and visually and formally stunning, series of the year.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
765,Station Eleven,1,"It achieves its own beauty and coherence, embodying Mandel’s point about the importance of art adapting to the circumstances of the moment.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
766,Station Eleven,1,"It is the series’ willingness to stare unblinkingly at the ugly, incomprehensible aspects of mortal existence that save it from becoming maudlin. Station Eleven remains affecting because its earnestness never feels less than hard-won.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
767,Station Eleven,1,"For all the horrors of the premise, you can't help but be comforted by a series driven by the faith that humanity's creativity and kinship will always endure.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
768,Station Eleven,1,"Adapted from Emily St. John Mandel's sprawling, time-hopping post-apocalyptic novel, the book's transition to TV results in a more streamlined but still flawed exercise in end-of-the-world storytelling.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
769,Station Eleven,1,"It asks us to think about big questions - the importance of community, memory, shared history and art.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
770,Station Eleven,1,"Station Eleven is a slow burn. The first few episodes look beautiful but move at a stately pace. If you can stick with it, you will be rewarded.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
771,Station Eleven,1,"It's an intelligent, genre-bending piece with a hint of the uncanny. Well worth checking out.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
772,Station Eleven,1,Station Eleven depicts a post-apocalyptic world where meaning still exists and darkness and trauma haven't won.,HBO MAX,98%,73%,54

774,Station Eleven,1,"At its best, Station Eleven knows when to stray away from its source material -- to which it remains faithfully dedicated to throughout -- in all the right places, building upon the rich world Mandel created.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
775,Station Eleven,1,"Based on the 2014 novel by Emily St. John Mandel, and adapted by Patrick Somerville, it's actually a surprisingly appropriate story at this moment, embracing new life more than it grieves what has been lost.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
776,Station Eleven,1,"Station Eleven has some of the mournful, big-canvas flavor of that earlier HBO show. It's a puzzle-box of a series, with the narrative elegantly switching timelines between the start of the flu in 2020, and the decimated results 20 years later.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
777,Station Eleven,1,"A hopeful story of human care and resilience, and a defiant manifesto for the value of creativity.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54

779,Station Eleven,1,"Station Eleven requires audiences to pay attention, offering up a dramatic tapestry of considerable depth. Spanning a twenty-year time period encompassing flu outbreaks, population obliteration, and then recovery, Station Eleven is engrossing stuff.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54

782,Station Eleven,1,The result is not only satisfactory but in many cases fascinating. [Full review in Spanish],HBO MAX,98%,73%,54

790,Station Eleven,1,"Grace, hope, and encouragement are foundational elements of ""Station Eleven"" that help turn what could've been a very bad idea into a profoundly cathartic experience.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
791,Station Eleven,1,"With as much emphasis placed on the characters and emotional drama as the sci-fi elements, Station Eleven is a show that's easy to get hooked on and hard not to bemoan the seemingly long wait for the next episodes.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
792,Station Eleven,1,"Watch the season's coming attractions at the end of the episode. It'll put the first episode in a new, more hopeful light, and it makes the relationships that were established make more sense.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
793,Station Eleven,1,"Through masterful directing and editing, each episode conveys the way that history lives and breathes within memory, coexisting with the present, whether within a performance or a fugue state.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
794,Station Eleven,1,"The subject matter might not be something that everyone wants to embrace. It's about a pandemic and its aftermath. But it is done with such beauty, sensitivity and assuredness that, really, it must be seen.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
795,Station Eleven,1,One of the most moving depictions of the resilience and sheer depth of feeling of human beings I have ever seen.,HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
796,Station Eleven,1,"Like the 2014 novel on which it's based, Station Eleven is not about a pandemic, not really-it's about the way art, community, and family endure even after the end of civilization as we know it.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
797,Station Eleven,1,"The 10-episode miniseries pulls off an incredible feat: it is a masterpiece. The timing of our own pandemic escalates the horror and doom of the show, but also makes every emotional beat even stronger.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
798,Station Eleven,1,"As Station Eleven moves forward, it becomes clear that the series' denseness is its greatest success. It weaves the stories of its eight principal characters in a way that never feels redundant or overcomplicated.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54

811,Station Eleven,1,"The depiction of theatrical performance here is moving -- suggesting a power in connection, through storytelling, that sustains under the worst of circumstances. That spirit shines through a flawed but bighearted adaptation.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54
812,Station Eleven,1,"Somerville smartly plays to the strength of his medium, wisely combining certain threads and separating out some of the storylines into standalone episodes.",HBO MAX,98%,73%,54

1166,Friends,1,"While not one of the absolute greats, The Last One deserves a place here for reasons of sentimentality. Put simply, it's the last one. It's the end of an era. That's not to say it lacks for laughs. There are plenty here.",HBO MAX,79%,94%,24

1168,Friends,1,"I always felt ""Friends"" respected me -- and my intelligence. Mostly because the show never seemed to be trying to make the audience laugh. It was more like the characters were laughing with us -- and, better yet, they usually weren't laughing at all.",HBO MAX,79%,94%,24
1169,Friends,1,"Friends was rarely less than consistently funny, boasting some of the finest acting and sharpest writing of any American sitcom. Ever. Period.",HBO MAX,79%,94%,24

1179,Titans,1,"These characters need to be given more room to grow as well as expand upon their individual storylines. Other than those constrictions, the series is fun and riveting television with great action, a fantastic cast and thrilling storytelling.",HBO MAX,86%,67%,20
1180,Titans,1,"Even though this season feels more like a Bat Family show with a little bit of Kory and Gar mixed in, this seems to be Titans at its strongest.",HBO MAX,86%,67%,20
1181,Titans,1,The show seems plenty watchable -- and occasionally jarring in its surprises -- without feeling like a top-tier series. Part of that has to do with a storyline involving the villain Red Hood that inches along in advancing the plot.,HBO MAX,86%,67%,20
1182,Titans,1,DC's 'Titans' Season 3 Wastes No Time Proving It Is The Best Season Yet.,HBO MAX,86%,67%,20
1183,Titans,1,"This is very much a story of two Robins and the man who raised them, and in that way it feels powerful and intimate. But fans of the wider Titans team might be left wanting as the laser-sharp focus centers on Dick Grayson and Jason Todd.",HBO MAX,86%,67%,20
1184,Titans,1,"This three-episode premiere was bursting at the seams with drama, culminating in one of the most shocking scenes in the history of the series and setting the tone for the rest of the season.",HBO MAX,86%,67%,20
1185,Titans,1,"But for the most part, thanks to some major early character deaths and decisions, Titans Season 3 rivals even Batman's darkest tales for their grown-up sensibilities - probably because it's adapting a couple of them at once.",HBO MAX,86%,67%,20
1186,Titans,1,"Best season yet! Brenton Thwaites continues to stand out as an excellent live action Nightwing, and the move to Gotham helps to focus the show. DC fans will be pleased.",HBO MAX,86%,67%,20
1187,Titans,1,"By far the best season yet. It fixes most issues from seasons past, and Red Hood is a brutal villain! Finally this show is getting good -- REALLY good.",HBO MAX,86%,67%,20

1195,Rick and Morty,1,"It's all incredibly bleak, and somewhat shocking, but incredibly good TV while it lasts.",HBO MAX,94%,87%,22
1196,Rick and Morty,1,"""Mort Dinner Rick Andre"" isn't the kind of premiere that suggests a new direction for Rick and Morty -- as a matter of fact, it seems to confirm we're heading in the old one. But that's fine with me.",HBO MAX,94%,87%,22
1197,Rick and Morty,1,"It's Rick and Morty doing hacky action at its best to kick things off, and naturally, we wouldn't have it any other way.",HBO MAX,94%,87%,22
1198,Rick and Morty,1,"The opening salvo of the new season is spectacular: insane joke density, an ever-present silliness brushing up against bad taste, awkward social situations laid bare, and hilariously tearing classic sci-fi and genre conventions a new one.",HBO MAX,94%,87%,22
1199,Rick and Morty,1,"When a show's middle-of-the-road episode would be the highlight of another series, it is clear that the series has entered another echelon of television. It's no secret that Rick and Morty is in that echelon.",HBO MAX,94%,87%,22
1200,Rick and Morty,1,"""Mort Dinner Rick Andre"" is a solid season opener. No fills (though lots of fins). A few great lines mean the incoming Nimbus can now take a seat at the conversation concerning the show's best ever guest characters.",HBO MAX,94%,87%,22
1201,Rick and Morty,1,"Yes, Rick and Morty is as funny and sharp as ever. But this time around, Rick isn't in control.",HBO MAX,94%,87%,22
1202,Rick and Morty,1,"As season openers go, this is a really solid entry from Rick and Morty. Nimbus is an instantly memorable character and the Morty storyline is a reminder that Morty is capable of having hilarious adventures without Rick's direct involvement.",HBO MAX,94%,87%,22
1203,Rick and Morty,1,"Thanks to the guidance of creators Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland, the fifth season continues to develop while it blows our minds with new universes, timelines and TV-MA situations, making it more than just a sci-fi toon with the occasional dick joke.",HBO MAX,94%,87%,22
1204,Rick and Morty,1,"A tiny, almost throwaway plot detail can mutate into a gloriously surreal digression that threatens to overwhelm the main narrative. You find this in the best Simpsons episodes too, but I've rarely seen it done with more outrageous verve than it is here.",HBO MAX,94%,87%,22
1205,Rick and Morty,1,"The rapidity of the laughs and the rat-a-tat style of the whip-smart dialogue is sometimes dizzying, but what sets this apart from the similarly toned Family Guy is the jokes stay with the story.",HBO MAX,94%,87%,22
1206,Rick and Morty,1,It's a quite brilliant 22 minutes and one with an implicit moral.,HBO MAX,94%,87%,22
1207,Rick and Morty,1,"It's kooky, irreverent, innovative and fun... 'm curious to see where Season Five takes us.",HBO MAX,94%,87%,22
1208,Rick and Morty,1,The simultaneous fondness for the recurring motifs of speculative fiction and its irreverent mocking of twists and tools that have been done to death are central to this show's duende. And that's also a major reason we love Rick.,HBO MAX,94%,87%,22
1209,Rick and Morty,1,"""Mort Dinner Rick Andre"" is another functional Rick and Morty episode... But a functional Rick and Morty still guarantees you a lot of clever sci-fi tropes taken to extremes in creative ways, so, yeah, pretty good.",HBO MAX,94%,87%,22
1210,Rick and Morty,1,"The Season 5 premiere doesn't necessarily feel like a return to ""classic"" Rick and Morty, and nor does it feel like a dramatic departure. But the episode's straightforwardness... is a welcome shift.",HBO MAX,94%,87%,22
1211,Rick and Morty,1,"Rick and Morty persists not only for its inversion of sci-fi tropes, clever pop culture riffing and raw hilarity. It continues to hold our interest in a way few shows do because it knows we are all capable of great and terrible things.",HBO MAX,94%,87%,22
1212,Rick and Morty,1,"If ""Rick and Morty"" wants to toss in some more serialized stuff into Season 5 instead of trying to constantly outdo itself, that might be a way to keep this early momentum going.",HBO MAX,94%,87%,22
1213,Rick and Morty,1,"""Mort Dinner Rick Andre"" is a pleasant start to the new season, and a good reminder why we enjoy having these weirdos around.",HBO MAX,94%,87%,22
1214,Rick and Morty,1,"If not the biggest or most daring season premiere the series has delivered, ""Mort Dinner Rick Andre"" is nonetheless an enjoyable start to the new season.",HBO MAX,94%,87%,22
1215,Rick and Morty,1,"The premiere shows a lot of promise for the season as a whole. It's just as inventive as ever, and by not resetting the status quo, there's more room for character development.",HBO MAX,94%,87%,22

1219,Raised by Wolves,1,Heres hoping Raised by Wolves continues to reward the audiences faith and doesnt let the shows enduring riddles swallow it whole.,HBO MAX,80%,80%,14
1220,Raised by Wolves,1,Science fiction of this kind is sorely needed in a time of pure spectacle. It has a canvas that is rich to gaze at but it’s the intellectual stimulation that really delivers.,HBO MAX,80%,80%,14
1221,Raised by Wolves,1,The Ridley Scott-produced HBO Max series about warring religious and atheist factions has entered its second season. And it’s time you started paying attention.,HBO MAX,80%,80%,14
1222,Raised by Wolves,1,"There is simply nothing like Raised by Wolves on television. It’s sci-fi, but it also really leans into fantasy. It’s stocked with strange ideas and compelling performances, and has a keen sense of aesthetic.",HBO MAX,80%,80%,14
1223,Raised by Wolves,1,Season 2 never risks becoming boring -- the minimum requirement for any hourlong series. Collin and Salim alone should hold your attention.,HBO MAX,80%,80%,14

1225,Raised by Wolves,1,"While the show's canvas has expanded, it hasn't lost its focus on the big questions of faith, identity, and family it's been wrestling with since the pilot.",HBO MAX,80%,80%,14
1226,Raised by Wolves,1,"It takes about 20 minutes to find its footing again, but S2 moves even faster & is more interesting than S1. Collin & Salim are wonderful additions to Ridley Scott's androids.",HBO MAX,80%,80%,14
1227,Raised by Wolves,1,"So far, Raised By Wolves Season 2 isn't trying to appeal to a wider fanbase, but is playing to its core audience of weirdos. The new season doesn't just feed us; it gorges us on knotty science fiction and bonkers plot twists.",HBO MAX,80%,80%,14
1228,Raised by Wolves,1,"It is clear from the start this season is trying to raise the stakes from season one. The bizarre, twisted, Sci-Fi feel fans know and love doesn't take long to show up.",HBO MAX,80%,80%,14
1229,Raised by Wolves,1,"While its two-part premiere feels like a return to status quo, Season 2 kicks off with deepening emotional mysteries. The performances remain impeccable, and the show is still poised to be a haunting exploration of faith and flesh.",HBO MAX,80%,80%,14

1231,The Tourist,1,This surprisingly gripping limited series is perfectly entertaining and has everything you'd assume from an action drama.,HBO MAX,97%,65%,31
1232,The Tourist,1,"A lot of Harry or Jack Williams previous work, such as Baptiste, it was very grounded and set in the real world, which at times resulted in the twists and turns feeling rather unbelievable. This show has never felt believable!",HBO MAX,97%,65%,31
1233,The Tourist,1,"Even if it doesn’t wind up exactly where you hoped, in its stronger moments Tourist is a trip worth taking . . . at least some of the way.",HBO MAX,97%,65%,31
1234,The Tourist,1,"This can be very funny at times  a traffic jam caused by two turtles rooting in the middle of the road is an early highlight. But the focus remains the two-fold mystery: who exactly is our hero, and why does at least one somebody want him dead?",HBO MAX,97%,65%,31
1235,The Tourist,1,"Overall, I dont think anyone will be disappointed with The Tourist and it may actually surprise some people. There is nothing here you havent seen before but it is delivered in an entertaining package.",HBO MAX,97%,65%,31
1236,The Tourist,1,"The Tourist hooked us in with its story, plus the performances by Dornan, Macdonald and Brune-Franklin. Let’s hope the story continues to be interesting as the season goes on.",HBO MAX,97%,65%,31
1237,The Tourist,1,"The cast is from mixed national backgrounds and it’s scripted by two Brits, yet an Australian flavour is immediately apparent in the form of its spectacularly filmed desert setting.",HBO MAX,97%,65%,31
1238,The Tourist,1,"Despite the uneven tone, The Tourist executes its story with style.",HBO MAX,97%,65%,31
1239,The Tourist,0,"What seems at the outset like a chance for Jamie Dornan to do some heavy existential lifting never quite makes good on that promise. Instead, “he Tourist”eventually settles into a conventional web of TV intrigue.",HBO MAX,97%,65%,31

1852,Sharp Objects,1,"[It's] gripping enough but requires patience. It's non-linear in structure, and be prepared, because while it's a murder mystery on the surface, it's about the exploitation and manipulation of women and the self-damage that results.",HBO MAX,92%,83%,130

2351,The Outsider,1,"Quite whether it needed to be this bloody slow, or all the jails and strip joints and forests in Georgia seemingly filmed through that same cowl, is up for debate. For all that, if you allow this to grab, it will.",HBO MAX,91%,83%,72
2352,The Outsider,1,"The whirlingly macabre, ruthlessly tense, and transfixingly spooky mood of The Outsider makes the mini-series a must-see this spring.",HBO MAX,91%,83%,72
2353,The Outsider,1,Richard Price did an excellent job in maintaining the suspense and terror in each of the episodes. [Full review in Spanish],HBO MAX,91%,83%,72
2354,The Outsider,1,Richard Price's adaptation... does not disappoint. [Full review in Spanish],HBO MAX,91%,83%,72
2355,The Outsider,1,"The fear is tangible. So is the grief. How quickly tragedy can strike, and how inexplicable it can seem. But there is a purpose here, and as is the case with so much of Stephen King's work, that purpose is rooted in hatred and evil.",HBO MAX,91%,83%,72
2356,The Outsider,1,"Once ""The Outsider"" becomes more of a conventional thriller, trading over some of its atmosphere for more classic suspense and twists, it still never loses its depths.",HBO MAX,91%,83%,72
2357,The Outsider,1,"It remains to be seen whether The Outsider can pull off its pivot into the paranormal and deliver a satisfying pay-off. However, this opening bill certainly haunted the imagination.",HBO MAX,91%,83%,72

2359,The Outsider,1,"HBO's choice to air these first two unrelentingly grim episodes back to back is a smart one-and not just because it's the perfect set-up for some clever, tension-easing joke about how director and star Jason Bateman can possibly be in two places at once.",HBO MAX,91%,83%,72

2380,The Outsider,0,"The stakes here seem to be massive; gradually, it becomes clear that an epidemic of darkness is overtaking many. But getting there, with so little in the way of character or freshness of tone, simply exhausts even an interested viewer.",HBO MAX,91%,83%,72

2382,The Outsider,1,"What's most pleasant, if that's the word, about ""The Outsider"" is its emphasis on classic ordinary-mortal shoe-leather investigation - no supercomputers or genius hackers getting results at warp speed, relatively little action even advanced by telephone.",HBO MAX,91%,83%,72
2383,The Outsider,1,"Stephen King adaptations have a spotty track record, one that isn't helped by the sheer abundance of them. HBO's The Outsider bucks those odds, delivering a taut, noir-ish thriller.",HBO MAX,91%,83%,72

2387,The Outsider,0,"Slowness, however, is not the issue; nor does it seem right to peg it all on tone. The characters keep remarking that something just doesn't add up. It's as if they're writing this review themselves.",HBO MAX,91%,83%,72
2388,The Outsider,1,"With the help of a great cast (led by Ben Mendelsohn) and eerie, stark direction from Emmy-winner Jason Bateman, ""The Outsider"" isn't on the level of Price's past work - but it's far better than this story has any right to be.",HBO MAX,91%,83%,72

2390,The Outsider,0,"Like so many of King's mammoth tomes, The Outsider could easily have been distilled into a movie. Instead, we get a 10-episode slog through crime-drama cliché so oppressive, it threatens to overshadow Erivo's brilliance.",HBO MAX,91%,83%,72

2496,The Undoing,0,"The Undoing has an intriguing mystery at its core, and a wonderful ensemble, but questionable structural choices give the series an odd ""stop and go"" feeling, padding it out to its lengthy runtime of 332 minutes.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100

2516,The Undoing,1,"It's Kidman who is most impressive, though. She has already delivered one of the best performances of her career in the first two episodes of The Undoing, with Kelley's material clearly getting the most out of her once again.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100

2522,The Undoing,1,"The first episode really is terrific, just less so than Big Little Lies. Still, it's worth seeing for the Kidman-Grant acting duel and Donald Sutherland as Kidman's infinitely arrogant and judgmental father.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100

2526,The Undoing,1,"The Undoing is fine. This is thanks entirely to the strength of its cast, and had the show trusted more in that and less into making it a quasi-murder mystery, it might have landed better.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100

2528,The Undoing,1,"The Undoing has an uncanny knack of digging its fingers under your skin. That's because, above all, it's a show which, though you might hate yourself for it, leaves you with the nagging need to know which of these rich folks is the rottenest of them all.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100

2539,The Undoing,1,"It's the kind of role that could easily turn toward hokey, but Kidman is able to bring such empathy and intensity to the part, holding the show on her shoulders and doing so gracefully.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100
2540,The Undoing,1,"The Undoing nods towards its characters' manifold privileges, but never quite manages to probe any further than surface level. As soapy melodrama or a glamorous whodunnit, though, it is unimpeachable.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100
2541,The Undoing,1,"Again, from the first episode at least, it appears to be about deceit and the way it can create serious delusions beyond our control, often with heartbreaking consequences.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100

2547,The Undoing,1,The Undoing is definitely not the same type of story as Big Little Lies but it does have enough going for it that you will likely be tuning in over the six weeks the series airs on HBO and may even enjoy it as a binge once all episodes are available.,HBO MAX,75%,66%,100
2548,The Undoing,0,"The story has gossipy moms, an elite school and a murder investigation. Yet neither the sharp performances nor the lush window dressing can save scripts that have so little to say.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100

2556,The Undoing,1,I was so shocked and riveted that I'm counting the days until I can see how it all ends in that final chapter. Exactly how a great page-turner is supposed to work.,HBO MAX,75%,66%,100
2557,The Undoing,1,"It's no masterpiece, but terrifically loaded with twists.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100
2558,The Undoing,1,The narrative starts to gel once Kidman begins attempting to navigate the mess her life has become. It's what makes Big Little Lies thrive and The Undoing a good show.,HBO MAX,75%,66%,100
2559,The Undoing,0,"A bad man getting away with a bad thing? Lawyers obfuscating the wheels of justice? It's all too familiar. And perhaps this is just 2020 talking, but it's a little exhausting, too.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100

2561,The Undoing,0,"While beautiful to look at, the show struggles to say something compelling as it's more interested in amplifying the melodrama instead of delving deep into its more interesting subjects.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100
2562,The Undoing,1,"Ms. Bier has, in subtle ways, brought a cinematic quality to the Kelley TV formula, although one person's Emmy-aspiring drama is still another person's wealth porn. The Undoing is plush to the point of voyeuristic ecstasy.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100
2563,The Undoing,0,"Kidman is fine from moment to moment, but her character is tossed about so, as facts turn to lies and lies look like facts, that a whole person hardly comes together - she seems held together by shellac.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100
2564,The Undoing,0,"This should all be sexily entertaining, and even fun, with Kidman and Hugh Grant playing Grace and Jonathan, and Kelley supplying the banter they exchange around the townhouse kitchen island. And for one episode it is.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100
2565,The Undoing,0,The murder case wends its way to trial while more revelations come to light. By the fifth episode the story feels fully spent and too thinly stretched. Beauty and mood can take things only so far.,HBO MAX,75%,66%,100
2566,The Undoing,0,The Undoing becomes overly long and formulaic. It's less interesting than Big Little Lies and has less on its mind socio-politically than Little Fires Everywhere.,HBO MAX,75%,66%,100
2567,The Undoing,0,"Even if ""The Undoing"" finds its way around to acknowledging its rich, white protagonists are bad people - and they definitely are - it's already too late to turn the six-episode series into a scathing censure on privilege.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100
2568,The Undoing,1,"The Undoing has the potential to be more substantive than it is, and it's a little disappointing that it isn't. Still, it offers a moody sense of atmosphere, a welcome reminder of New York's pre-pandemic days,",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100

2575,The Undoing,1,"Given its strong start, it'd be a shame if The Undoing comes undone at the end and fails to stick its landing, but I'll be sticking with it through to the end, if only to see whether Grace and Jonathan's marriage survives.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100
2576,The Undoing,1,"An always watchable murder mystery, it never becomes completely gripping, neither a nuanced study of a wealthy family falling apart or a trashy melodrama where Nicole Kidman loses it over six episodes..",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100

2579,The Undoing,1,"Go for the high-wattage cast, gorgeous outfits and stunning homes; stay for the secrets, twists and shocks. The Undoing is perfect entertainment for a cold-weather, stay-at-home time.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100
2580,The Undoing,0,"What starts out as a lively drama about scandal among the one percent turns into a turgid thriller and later a courtroom drama, recalling some of the hackier tendencies of past Kelley shows.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100
2581,The Undoing,0,"It's almost hard to believe that stars Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant, series writer David E. Kelley and series director Susanne Bier could come up with a show so limp, so generic, so dispiritingly bad as this six-hour drama.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100
2582,The Undoing,0,"Not even Kidman's performance, nor sharp turns from the likes of Hugh Grant and Donald Sutherland, can quite center its diffuse interests.",HBO MAX,75%,66%,100

2589,The Righteous Gemstones,1,It’s odd to think that a comedy that trafficks so heavily in sophomoric humor can also be filled with love. But that’s what McBride excels in: the ability to hold seemingly opposing natures in one entity at any given time.,HBO MAX,81%,84%,17
2590,The Righteous Gemstones,1,I sort of ditched on Season One...then I binged the first 4 episodes of Season 2...now I am going back and watching rest of Season One. I was wrong to quit...this show is hilarious.,HBO MAX,81%,84%,17

2598,The Righteous Gemstones,0,"Season two of ""The Righteous Gemstones"" is an ambitious, intermittently hysterical mess. McBride and Hill attempt to expand the show outward, often into full-on action set pieces that, while impressive, fail to find cohesion with the rest of the series.",HBO MAX,81%,84%,17

3591,Yellowjackets,1,Lord of the Flies is probably the best metaphor we've got for what happens when society breaks down and humans return to our most primal urges. Yellowjackets takes that concept in a particularly dark direction.,VUDU,100%,78%,73

3606,Yellowjackets,1,"The larger Yellowjackets discussion isn’t just about the parasocial adoption of others’ trauma, but the way we talk about the girls and the show and regress into a deliriously unhinged version of the ’90s that I didn’t even know I wanted, and it rules.",VUDU,100%,78%,73

3608,Yellowjackets,1,"The show puts a fiendishly clever twist on a familiar set-up, which makes for an experience as morbidly addictive as tracking Omicron figures every morning.",VUDU,100%,78%,73
3609,Yellowjackets,1,"This is a great, entertaining show that could go in so many different directions. It's built up in really surprising ways, with lots of head fakes and red herrings and some surprising twists and turns.",VUDU,100%,78%,73

3634,Yellowjackets,1,"Yellowjackets does a good job at tackling three genres at once. It's a thriller, a coming of age story and a survival story, and all of it is presented in a way that makes us want to see more.",VUDU,100%,78%,73
3635,Yellowjackets,1,"At once fast-paced and slow-burning, Yellowjackets benefits from some smart casting between the younger and older versions of the characters and the impressive eclectic ensemble of former '90s ""stars"" that have been gathered together.",VUDU,100%,78%,73
3636,Yellowjackets,1,"Yellowjackets will obviously be compared to ABC's Lost, for its plot surrounding how a group of people survived a plane crash, but the Showtime series seems to be more properly packed for its high-concept scenario.",VUDU,100%,78%,73

3641,Yellowjackets,1,"What makes this patchwork of styles, tones and time periods hang together is the thread of psychological realism that runs through every scene.",VUDU,100%,78%,73

3643,Yellowjackets,1,It really might be the next Lost. Just don't say that too loudly. You don't want to jinx it.,VUDU,100%,78%,73
3644,Yellowjackets,1,"It's a murder mystery. It's a feminist fable. It's a political drama. It's a coming-of-middle-age story. It's a ghost story. (Maybe.) And it's a lot of fun to watch, no maybes about that.",VUDU,100%,78%,73
3645,Yellowjackets,1,"Yellowjackets remains too fun to write off just yet. Its gutsiness sets it apart from the usual survival-drama fare, and its performances suggest a deeper story even if we don't know what it is quite yet.",VUDU,100%,78%,73
3646,Yellowjackets,1,"It's a blazing start to a series speculating about the dark, seething rage and violence that lurks in young women given the agency to create and control their own society.",VUDU,100%,78%,73
3647,Yellowjackets,1,"Don't be fooled by its teen show trappings: ""Yellowjackets"" is a pitch black parable of human desperation that will creep its way under your skin given the chance.",VUDU,100%,78%,73
3648,Yellowjackets,1,"There is something incredibly bingeable about [Yellowjackets] in that the writing keeps building on itself, growing in potency as we get to know these characters better and better, courtesy of one of the best ensembles of the season.",VUDU,100%,78%,73

3650,Yellowjackets,1,Yellowjackets generally favors the spooky over the gory with the greatest emphasis on character and relationships. It's difficult for shows to get buzz in a 500-series TV/streaming universe but Yellowjackets merits attention.,VUDU,100%,78%,73
3651,Yellowjackets,1,"Feels like a hybrid of other shows that nonetheless forms its own compelling teen/adult psychological study, with some dashes of horror and cannibalism added to the mix.",VUDU,100%,78%,73
3652,Yellowjackets,1,"At heart, ""Yellowjackets"" is a fun, pulpy twist on a midlife theme that runs back to ""Thirtysomething"" and beyond: How did I end up here?",VUDU,100%,78%,73

3655,Yellowjackets,1,"It honestly feels like nothing else on television right now, and though its pace is somewhat more glacial than its trailers might have initially indicated, there are moments where the tension is nigh unbearable.",VUDU,100%,78%,73
3656,Yellowjackets,1,"There may be some disappointment on the horizon, but for now, Yellowjackets is about as addictive as television thrillers get.",VUDU,100%,78%,73
3657,Yellowjackets,1,"Many of its influences already overlap, and thus work together well. The ones that don't can at times combine to create something that feels new and potent, but at others make it feel like the stew could have done with fewer ingredients.",VUDU,100%,78%,73
3658,Yellowjackets,1,"When it commits to its chilling suspense, the show is utterly fascinating to watch... Let's just hope the payoff, and the inevitable reveals to come, are worth the slow-burning effort.",VUDU,100%,78%,73
3659,Yellowjackets,1,"The survival timeline is pure horror, all steadily increasing dread and glimpses of grotesque violence. The writers seed the story with hints of the supernatural, but wisely keep it vague, at least in the 6 episodes made available for review.",VUDU,100%,78%,73

3681,Star Trek: Discovery,1,"In Season 4, the crew of Discovery is united, whole, and providing comfort and hope both to each other, and to a world that needs that right now. Maybe that's the most radical reinvention of all.",VUDU,86%,36%,15
3682,Star Trek: Picard,1,Season 2 of Star Trek: Picard ups the action and delivers a solid Star Trek storyline.,VUDU,86%,40%,21
3683,Star Trek: Picard,0,"While it starts strong, and it's focus on recontextualizing trauma remains earnestly admirable, the season ultimately doesn't have enough story to propel its 10-hour runtime, leading to meandering plots that rely more on nostalgia then storytelling.",VUDU,86%,40%,21
3684,Star Trek: Picard,0,"Season 2 immediately reverses track. Star Trek: Picard gives in to audience expectation, maybe even pressure, to try and tap not just a 1990s but also 1980s nostalgia for the franchise. It largely fails at both.",VUDU,86%,40%,21

3688,Star Trek: Picard,1,Star Trek: Picard is rich with mythology and features some of Patrick Stewarts best work as the legendary Jean-Luc Picard. This is great storytelling and the benchmark against which all future Star Trek series should be measured.,VUDU,86%,40%,21
3689,Star Trek: Picard,1,"Star Trek: Picard is back for its second season, hitting the ground running with immediate action, top-notch performances, and no subtlety.",VUDU,86%,40%,21

3696,Star Trek: Picard,1,"The thing about those bad first seasons of “Trek” shows? They’re always the precursor to a startling turnaround. Sometimes that uptick happens in Season 2, sometimes later. “Picard” has already made it so.",VUDU,86%,40%,21
3697,Star Trek: Picard,1,"The producers and writers seem intent on balancing the familiar tropes of Trek that fans love so while still sticking to the mission of doing something different with, and for, Patrick Stewart the actor. This is a good start in that regard.",VUDU,86%,40%,21

3712,Westworld,1,"At this point, you sort of have to admire Westworld's resistance to crowd pleasing. We're so far beyond the lauded robot cowboy show at this point, I've swerved back around into begrudgingly respecting the Nolans' absurdly complicated narrative.",VUDU,81%,74%,30

3715,Westworld,1,One may miss the intriguing narrative loops and interior fugues of seasons one and two... But there is nonetheless shivery fun to be had as Westworld imagines what was probably the inevitable outcome of all this tinkering with synthetic thought.,VUDU,81%,74%,30
3716,Westworld,1,"Its capacity to fascinate us remains intact, especially as the themes which have always been lurking in the show become more present.",VUDU,81%,74%,30

3718,Westworld,1,"The series still feels mysterious in a fun way and ominous in its themes and methods but this ""reset"" mode also has its drawbacks.",VUDU,81%,74%,30
3719,Westworld,0,"The new season of often wayward drama doesn’t just treat many of the people onscreen as NPCs. Withholding to a fault and placing a wearying emphasis on misdirection, it leaves viewers in the dark.",VUDU,81%,74%,30
3720,Westworld,1,"Westworld returns with a slow, somewhat vibrant, and irregular Season 4. It lacks a hook or an intrigue, which makes it a little less engaging than usual. [Full review in Spanish]",VUDU,81%,74%,30
3721,Westworld,1,"Say what you will about Westworld, the show is unafraid to take risks and swing for the fences, and the rare moments it fully succeeds are more than enough to get me to plug back in.",VUDU,81%,74%,30
3722,Westworld,1,"Beautiful, baffling, and bonkers. A welcome resurgence for Joy and Nolan’s box of violent delights, and one that firmly dispels any hint that Westworld might have gone south.",VUDU,81%,74%,30
3723,Westworld,0,"It’s resolved to do what its done before to the best of its abilities, like a piece of A.I. tasked with replicating the human experience, but tapping out after it learns “excitement” and “deception.”",VUDU,81%,74%,30
3724,Westworld,1,"It's hard to talk about Westworld's fourth season without fear of giving too much away, so I'll just say this: It's awesome.",VUDU,81%,74%,30
3725,Westworld,1,“Westworld” is essentially giving us the “The Matrix” sequel that we never got.,VUDU,81%,74%,30
3726,Westworld,1,"Westworld left the western theme park after Season 2, but continues to deepen the world in which that theme park could exist. Season 4 presents the most intriguing combination yet of Season 3's science-fiction and the themes of the first two seasons.",VUDU,81%,74%,30
3727,Westworld,1,"You may be wondering if you’ll need a refresher before tackling this new batch of episodes, but I was surprised at how easy to follow the show was — even if it had been more than two years since I last saw Maeve, Dolores and the destruction of Rehoboam.",VUDU,81%,74%,30

3731,Westworld,0,Westworld season 4 is ... a lot.,VUDU,81%,74%,30
3732,Westworld,1,The sinister quality of Westworld remains intact and there are gripping action sequences. Yet it’s hard to tell if the series is back on the rails as a vivid exploration of the power of myth and story.,VUDU,81%,74%,30
3733,Barry,1,"Season three of Barry three slides into another stratosphere: it's that blisteringly clever, deeply layered, piercingly moving and terrifically acted.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3734,Barry,1,"It just seems like we're quickly approaching a natural stopping point, though I happily acknowledge that Hader could find any number of pathways to explore.",VUDU,99%,89%,51

3736,Barry,1,"Given the moment of cultural backlash we’re living through, Barry feels eerily on the pulse. Always bleak, the supposed comedy is inching ever further into horror.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3737,Barry,1,More corrosive (and lethal) than ever... [Full review in Spanish],VUDU,99%,89%,51
3738,Barry,1,"“Barry” continues to be such a deceptively smart show about the human condition, while also being one of television’s funniest half hours. And the good news is that it picks up after a three-year hiatus as if no time has passed at all.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3739,Barry,1,"It has always been a good show, but in its third season, Barry is beyond good...in turns hilarious and tragic. In an era where there is so much good television, there isn’t anything else quite like Barry.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3740,Barry,1,Darker and smarter than ever. [Full review in Spanish],VUDU,99%,89%,51
3741,Barry,1,"While previous seasons asked if it was possible to change, or if Barry is doomed to a life of violence, this season is firmly dealing with consequences.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3742,Barry,1,Barry has always expertly balanced its tragicomedy demands so that even the funniest moments are laced with sadness while exploiting the absurd in the gloom. It’s a precarious tension but Hader and Berg have mastered it.,VUDU,99%,89%,51
3743,Barry,1,"This season is something close to a masterpiece in its meticulous set pieces and sun-washed cinematography, in its stunts and action sequences, and in deepening emotional stakes.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3744,Barry,1,"The brilliant writing is what truly seals the deal here: no series is more adept at painting itself into a corner, and then blasting itself out with a jaw-dropping moment no-one could possibly see coming.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3745,Barry,1,Barry is one of the tightest shows out there. Not a moment is wasted.,VUDU,99%,89%,51
3746,Barry,1,This season perfectly captures the mindset of being trapped in that zone between static existence and transition.,VUDU,99%,89%,51
3747,Barry,1,"Everyone in this world is weird, sad, and funny in their own unearthly way. As the lens pulls back, one thing becomes clear: Bill Hader and Alec Berg have created something brilliant, unlike anything weve seen before.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3748,Barry,1,"Three years and a pandemic has done nothing to dull the edges of Barry or Bill Hader’s funny and sometimes frightening performance, and Winkler and the rest of the cast are still at the top of their games in the third season.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3749,Barry,1,"Frankly, the averageness of all these people -- and all people -- is the crux of the show's sublime one-two punch of tragedy and giggles.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3750,Barry,1,"Hader, believably shifting moods from catatonic to manic, makes Barry someone to fear and also, despite ourselves, to cheer. He belongs in the pantheon with Walter White and Dexter Morgan. Simply put, Barry slays me.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3751,Barry,1,"Comedy lets Barry’s writers and performers deftly field all of these complex feelings, the fact that violence is abhorrent and yet compelling to watch, without feeling like it’s moralizing. Every squirm comes with an equally big laugh.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3752,Barry,1,"Delving deeper into Hollywood's quirks and its title character's double life, the crackling third season continues to operate like a high-wire act without a net.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3753,Barry,1,"Aside from these richly layered plot developments, the characterization and performances of Barry, Gene, Hank, and, above all Sally, help this hilarious and occasionally heart wrenching dramedy once again -- just like its title character -- hit the mark.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3754,Barry,1,"Mostly, the season opens as a cautionary tale about getting what you wish for. Much like the story of The Monkeys Paw, or Stephen Kings Pet Sematary, the things you thought you wanted may not turn out to be what they seemed. They may be way, way worse.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3755,Barry,1,This half-hour comedy is still one of television’s best suspense-filled thrillers.,VUDU,99%,89%,51
3756,Barry,1,"A master class on how to move a story forward without losing the spark that ignited it in the first place, keeping the tone without compromising substance. Full review in Spanish",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3757,Barry,1,The series still has its trademark dark humor and self-deprecating inside Hollywood humility. The difference here is that all point points from previous seasons lead to a dark intensity while sacrificing a fair portion of comic relief.,VUDU,99%,89%,51
3758,Barry,1,"Season 3 is every bit as high-octane, uproarious, and unhinged as ever — and the dark part of this dark comedy is slowly closing in.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3759,Barry,1,"The enthusiasm for acting which lit up Haders mobile features in the first two seasons is drained away. Hes now barely going through the motions of redemption. A show about faking it feels more fake, and therefore more true to itself than ever.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3760,Barry,1,"The show still somehow manages to accomplish the Herculean feat of topping itself, zigging when most shows would zag and finding new, creative ways to make you laugh out loud.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3761,Barry,1,"Barry more than justifies its existence as an ongoing series with a run of episodes that puts all of the show’s elements back in ridiculous, cruel harmony -- and in some cases go beyond anything Hader did in that immaculate first season.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3762,Barry,1,"It’s so good this season that I not only want to recommend it to Vulture readers, I want to hand out flyers to random people on the street, imploring them to watch...",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3763,Barry,1,"There's nothing on TV quite like Barry. The laughter is loud, but that makes the terrified silence more deafening.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3764,Barry,1,"Even though we have waited three years for more episodes of Barry, it is absolutely worth it. While there are only eight episodes before we have to wait for more, these are the best chapters of this series yet.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3765,Barry,1,"Barry is simply a masterpiece of deeply humane, hilarious satire.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3766,Barry,1,"In Season 3, the comic drama gets as dark and morally knotty as Better Call Saul. Like Bob Odenkirk’s Saul, Hader’s Barry proves that an SNL funnyman can turn out to be one of the great dramatic actors on TV.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3767,Barry,1,"Season 3 goes darker than this show every has before as it is unafraid to deep dive into PTSD, abuse, violence, humanity, and forgiveness. Filled with incredibly powerful performances by all involved, this is the best season yet.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3768,Barry,1,"Among the many gifts Bill Hader delivers in this fabulous new chapter of his series is that, in picking off almost exactly where he left us, it feels almost as if the last two years never happened. How great is that?",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3769,Barry,1,"Still strange, dark, harrowing and often — unexpectedly — very funny.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3770,Barry,1,"After a nearly three-year absence, Barry returns darker and funnier than ever. Bill Hader’s reluctant hitman continues to find himself caught between a farce and horror, and the actor is a shoo-in for another Emmy nomination (and maybe win).",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3771,Barry,1,"In its long-awaited third season, iBarryi is as assured and morosely hilarious as ever.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3772,Barry,1,I care about so much of Barry that I don’t care about the things that I don’t care about.,VUDU,99%,89%,51
3773,Barry,1,"Every element works together seamlessly to deliver brisk, packed, profound, emotional, disturbing, and hilarious half-hour episodes that are so delectably perfect that it makes you feel sorry for every other show.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3774,Barry,1,"In Season 3, the show has fully outgrown its cutesy premise to become one of TV's best thrill rides.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3775,Barry,1,"Season three of Barry sees one of televisions most compelling, darkly comic series stepping back into the light with nary a beat skipped, finding new moral complications for its widening cast of characters without losing its offbeat sense of humor.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3776,Barry,1,"The shocking originality of Hader's performance in the first season can't be replicated, of course, but he manages to maintain the quality of it throughout.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3777,Barry,1,"It was good in its first two seasons and, I am pleased to report, it is still really good in its... third season. Maybe even better than ever.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3778,Barry,1,"It’s one of the most meaningful, and complicated, uses of dark comedy on television. It’s also hard to tell whether the dark or the comedy will win in the end, but that’s what keeps us watching.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3779,Barry,1,"A richer and deeper character study than “Barry” has previously been, and... a pleasing reward for fans who’ve waited nearly three years for more of this story.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3780,Barry,1,"Where Barry or ""Barry"" goes next is an exciting, if trepidatious mystery. But both the man and the show are earning every step.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3781,Barry,1,"This attention to detail — the performances, the direction, the awareness, the comedy, the sense of purpose — all come together to make “Barry” great.",VUDU,99%,89%,51
3782,Barry,1,"At times its almost unsettling to watch  and thats thanks in massive part to Bill Hader, who continues to deliver one of the most impressively versatile performances on television.",VUDU,99%,89%,51

3792,The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"The series is never so engrossing that you forget about Clare and Henry’s interactions when she is a child. There is always that niggly feeling it’s not quite right, and the show doesn’t do enough to assuage that impression.",VUDU,38%,84%,40

3796,The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"Whether you are into romantic stories or not, this is an overall well-acted and executed series that makes great use of its six-episode run and redeems the novel that was beloved by so many fans.",VUDU,38%,84%,40
3797,The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Thinking ruins it in a very specific ways. Kick the mental tires too much on this genre romance, and the whole thing slides right into Skeeveyville.",VUDU,38%,84%,40

3807,The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"I think the most off-putting thing about The Time Traveler’s Wife, right from the jump, is how strangely chintzy and thin it looks.",VUDU,38%,84%,40
3808,The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"The two leads of The Time Traveler's Wife do their best to make complex moments of humanity crack through the wild hook, and Steven Moffat's deeper dive into the story via limited series offers up some moments, both funny and dramatic, that work.",VUDU,38%,84%,40
3809,The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"It's an admirable effort, but one that simply underscores how unadaptable this material might be -- the bottom line being that if time is indeed precious, these six episodes finally feel too much like a waste of it.",VUDU,38%,84%,40

3812,The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"The Time Traveler’s Wife is so unsatisfying, it’s a bit baffling why anybody, let alone Steven Moffat, whose work as a writer and showrunner includes Doctor Who and Sherlock, decided to have a go at it.",VUDU,38%,84%,40
3813,The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"It’s just a shame that The Time Traveler’s Wife sometimes feels, like its hero, as if it’s being pulled in a hundred different directions at once.",VUDU,38%,84%,40

3819,The Time Traveler's Wife,0,The story fails to convince that the couple shares much more than an understanding of the obstacles keeping them apart. So much time is spent on establishing the rules of this show’s game that there’s little room to play.,VUDU,38%,84%,40
3820,The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"Even if you don’t know the story of The Time Traveler’s Wife, it’s still a fun watch and one that is woven into Moffat’s other work. And who doesn’t want to see Theo James and Rose Leslie falling in love with each other out of order?",VUDU,38%,84%,40
3821,The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"That defining notion of object impermanence is what renders Henry and Clare's journey through time — and the series as a whole — all the more riveting, making it easy for us to be swept up in the story even if it only lasts for a short while.",VUDU,38%,84%,40

3990,Succession,1,"What is a bit concerning, though: Does ""Secession"" seem a little too self-aware of the champing-at-the-bit hype in which this series is now ensconced?",VUDU,94%,85%,93
3991,Succession,1,Bigger and better than ever.,VUDU,94%,85%,93
3992,Succession,1,Season Three of the HBO series goes full beast mode with varying degrees of success in what comes off as a primarily transactional cycle.,VUDU,94%,85%,93
3993,Succession,1,"The privileged, awful offspring of Logan Roy have to choose sides during the return of one of the best series on TV.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
3994,Succession,1,"Success hasn't spoiled Succession, as the Emmy-winning drama returns with all its Shakespearean and Murdochian overtones intact, with a bruising father-son battle over its fictional media empire. Stripped of that, the HBO series remains enormously fun.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
3995,Succession,1,"Two years was a long wait, but the payoff is glorious.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
3996,Succession,1,"Maybe it's churlish to complain about a series that's still consistently better written and more refreshingly caustic than anything else on TV. But for me, Season Three reveals some wear in a concept that once felt rousingly original.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
3997,Succession,1,"This new season of Succession is so much the tragic, sure, but also the better and funnier for it.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
3998,Succession,1,"...the joy of Succession lies, as ever, in its script, whose sheer ickiness and cringe factor comes out of the double toxicities of the Roy family's dysfunction...",VUDU,94%,85%,93
3999,Succession,1,"Propelled by the best ensemble cast you'll find anywhere-Nicholas Braun and Matthew Macfadyen are a dream team of lacerating laughs- Season 3 is the funniest, fiercest 'Succession' yet. It's a perverse pleasure to ogle the rich abusing their privileges.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4000,Succession,0,"Succession is often very funny, and always extremely bleak. But the show's window-dressing doesn't deliver the same vicarious thrill anymore.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4001,Succession,1,"Sarcasm and corporate jargon aside, Succession is an increasingly intimate look at how nobody can really hurt you like family.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4002,Succession,1,"I found myself laughing more than ever at creator Jesse Armstrong's super-wealthy drama queens and opportunists. The Veep vibe is stronger and sharper, with characters gnarling out insults that seem to turn common obscenities into metrical poetry.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4003,Succession,1,"It is a visceral pleasure to see Succession again. And its distinctive methods are intact: The seething jealousies and back-stabbing that unfold when the family unites; the flinty, often ferocious dialogue full of swearing and barking aggression.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4004,Succession,1,"There are more laughs to be had watching Succession than most TV comedies, a testament to the show's writers who imbue the Roy children with specific foibles and a general lack of self-awareness.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4005,Succession,1,"Every part of Succession shimmers. Armstrong's scripts are top-notch, brought to life by cinematographer Andrij Parekh, production designer Stephen Carter and director Mark Mylod, and set magnificently to Nicholas Britell's score.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4006,Succession,1,"The stakes couldn't be higher for the embattled Roy family. And, for those of us watching safely from afar, the fun couldn't be sweeter.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4007,Succession,1,"Succession season three delivers one helluva rollercoaster ride that keeps us gasping for air between the laugh-out-loud absurdity and intensely claustrophobic, emotional and no holds barred standoffs.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4008,Succession,1,"The dialogue is as scabrous and funny as ever and the performances are still perfection... Still, it has to be said: there's something missing this time.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4009,Succession,1,Triumphant return of TVs best.,VUDU,94%,85%,93
4010,Succession,1,There is still a lot of fight in all parties involved and it doesn't seem like things would die out any time soon.,VUDU,94%,85%,93
4011,Succession,1,"If Season 2 was a significant step up from the first, this third series is so miraculously funny yet mind-blowingly intense, Succession feels like it's now well on its way to reaching Sopranos, The West Wing, Mad Men-levels of excellence.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4012,Succession,1,Succession's biggest weapon has always been its whip-cracking dialogue and the writer Jesse Armstrong has raised his game.,VUDU,94%,85%,93
4013,Succession,1,Succession is back for its third season and it doesn't miss a beat.,VUDU,94%,85%,93
4014,Succession,1,"The good news is ""Succession"" remains the same show it was two years ago. The great news is it made the most of that time away to amplify all its strengths.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4015,Succession,1,"Crass and crude as ever, it's a delight to return to the filth of Succession.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4016,Succession,1,"The third series had a lot to live up to -- but it does not disappoint. From the moment the jangling theme tune by Nicholas Britell rolls, worming its way into your head, you know you are watching something expertly crafted.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4017,Succession,1,"Even in its most grandiose comedic moments, there is truth to Succession's cynical world that makes us realize yes, these idiots are absolutely in charge of our world and no, there's not really anything we can do about it.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4018,Succession,1,Sometimes we are all blessed in ways we are not prepared to comprehend. It's still good to try to acknowledge it. That's all this is.,VUDU,94%,85%,93
4019,Succession,1,"What struck me first as I dove back in was not how thrilling or dramatic this show can be, but how laugh-out-loud funny it is.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4020,Succession,1,"When they're throwing the most lavish and unbearable parties imaginable, Succession clicks. But every second we're talking directly about politics is a second we aren't making fun of Kendall for forgetting about his children.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4021,Succession,1,"So far, at any rate, Succession's latest season is certainly off the hook - a real good job do-er, full of little Machiavellian f***s, and funny enough to leave viewers laughing as if they grew up on a hyena farm.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4022,Succession,1,"Being a Roy is such a lonely endeavor, none of the members from this family can trust their relatives. The show makes you ponder: How much is too much money? At what point in financial stability do you stop being at ease and start becoming a prick?",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4023,Succession,1,"Succession is well-shot and has firecracker dialogue and a talented cast that is easy on the eyes. But it doesn't elevate its characters, horrible people all; it exposes them.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4024,Succession,1,"""Succession"" is crisper, funnier, and more confident than ever.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4025,Succession,1,"Season 3 returns with just as much petty hilarity, punishing woes, and blazing performances as previous seasons with a civil war storyline to keep you hooked on the exploits of these awful rich people.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4026,Succession,1,"The idea that Kendall, Shiv, Roman, and Connor are just damaged kids play-acting at adulthood is even more prominent this season, as the four siblings try to haggle, argue, and dissemble their way to common ground.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4027,Succession,1,"Succession started out telling a story about the Roy family fracturing before showing those bonds start to mend. This season, the bonds that tie these characters together are ripped to shreds and we get a front row seat to the show.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4028,Succession,1,"Again and again, Armstrong and his collaborators keep things fresh by reminding us that spinelessness is the defining characteristic for so many of its regulars.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4029,Succession,1,"Much of the way through a glimmeringly brutal season, the greatest challenge Succession has posed for itself is, once again, pulling insight and enjoyment out of staring into the heart of darkness.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4030,Succession,1,"Succession has quickly ascended to the type of series that ultimately defines a network, much like Game of Thrones and The Sopranos did for HBO years ago.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4031,Succession,1,"It's a slower burn than Season 2, but that merely opens up new avenues for our soulless antiheroes to twist in the wind, especially as the family civil war heats up.",VUDU,94%,85%,93
4032,The Sopranos,1,"A show about everything, that meant something, that adds up to no specific conclusion, or realisation, or point of clarity. The wheel turns. The American Nightmare continues.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4033,The Sopranos,1,"The Sopranos is written with psychological depth and made with creative freedom. The result is personal, but not impenetrable or surly. [Full review in Spanish]",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4034,The Sopranos,1,"The Sopranos came up with an ending just as murky and disorienting as the 85 hours that led up to it. Rather than betray its ethos by bowing to convention, The Sopranos went out on its own terms.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4035,The Sopranos,1,"Who knows? We'll never know. And it's better that way. If you're thinking there's a movie in the works, think again. It was supposed to end like this.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4036,The Sopranos,1,"Any explanation... no matter how smart or well-reasoned, misses the point. To explain it would diminish it.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4037,The Sopranos,1,"Rather than an ending that would stop the conversation about Tony Soprano, Chase gave us an ending that will keep us talking.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4038,The Sopranos,1,"Chase isn't the only auteur to turn an audience's bloodlust against itself, but unlike, say, Michael Haneke or Quentin Tarantino, he chose an unnervingly quiet way to leave us on the hook, in perpetuity.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4039,The Sopranos,1,It's still a master-class in building tension. David Chase mines more suspense out of a family talking at a diner as a young woman struggles to parallel park than most pure horror directors could even dream.,VUDU,92%,97%,31
4040,The Sopranos,0,"To me, it felt like an hourlong f--- you from a guy who has seen fan devotion for The Sopranos transform him from a little-known but well respected TV producer into one of the most legendary TV auteurs in history.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4041,The Sopranos,1,"[Creator David] Chase was true to himself, and that's what made The Sopranos brilliant on Sunday night, and the 85 episodes that went before.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4042,The Sopranos,1,"It's not TV, as HBO often reminded us. No, it was something on a much grander scale.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4043,The Sopranos,1,"There is some evidence to support the notion that Chase punk'd fans with mad, self-congratulatory glee... But I admire his zeal in defying expectation.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4044,The Sopranos,1,Chase played us like a grand piano.,VUDU,92%,97%,31
4045,The Sopranos,1,"It felt more violent, more disturbing, more unfair than even the most savage murders Chase has depicted over the course of six seasons, because the victim was us. He ended the series by whacking the viewer.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4046,The Sopranos,1,"Its final season mostly crackled, with the usual superior performances and writing from actors James Gandolfini and Edie Falco, and creator David Chase... For now it's curtains on an extraordinary achievement.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4047,The Sopranos,0,"David Chase, after so much brilliant work... seemed to be saying he could take it or leave it. So he left it.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4048,The Sopranos,1,"Dark, funny, strange, a perfect way to begin this final examination of these characters' twisted psyches.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4049,The Sopranos,1,"And so, bada-bing, just like a whacking, The Sopranos was done. But the range and capability of TV drama was expanded forever.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4050,The Sopranos,1,"Chase had a grand time in his almost playful home stretch, offering a clue-strewn valedictory episode and a beautifully unresolved stopping point.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4051,The Sopranos,1,"Somehow, though, it feels like the perfect final note. Why wouldn't a show that's taken such pleasure in rewriting the rules of storytelling go out in the least conventional way possible?",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4052,The Sopranos,1,"All of the death foreshadowing the author finds throughout the series is present, and it steps up a notch in the final season.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4053,The Sopranos,1,"David Chase, you sadist. We trusted you, and then you turned on us - and maybe we deserved it.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4054,The Sopranos,0,"While it is one thing to flout the conventions of television, it's another to flip dramatic tradition, not to mention your audience, the bird.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4055,The Sopranos,0,One can understand David Chase's desire to have a completely unique ending... But that doesn't mean we have to like it.,VUDU,92%,97%,31
4056,The Sopranos,1,Mr. Chase wanted to end his tale without melodrama or even a splashy denouement. He succeeded.,VUDU,92%,97%,31
4057,The Sopranos,1,"Think of it as complete at last, a perfect whole. It's finished but it's not over. Life goes on.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4058,The Sopranos,0,"For six seasons, the crime drama seemed worthy of being considered a work of art. But last night felt far too much like TV as usual with all its commercial compromises and unfulfilled promises.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4059,The Sopranos,1,"Sopranos looks to be taking us on one of its darkest journeys yet en route to the finish line, setting a tantalizing table for the forthcoming climax.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4060,The Sopranos,1,"If The Godfather: Part II offers a revisionist take on the 1950s American Dream, then The Sopranos is our elegy to that long-gone era of postwar affluence.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4061,The Sopranos,1,It may have been the greatest double-take -- by the audience -- in the history of American television.,VUDU,92%,97%,31
4062,The Sopranos,1,"Each of the final episodes was anticipated not so much with pleasure as dread, since each posed the risk of an unacceptable loss, as characters in whom we had invested years of attention were swept away.",VUDU,92%,97%,31
4063,The Wire,1,[Michael K.] Williams quietly dismantled preconceptions about masculinity and sexuality alike and became a hero and icon both on and off-screen. It's not his only great acting role.,VUDU,94%,97%,44
4064,The Wire,1,"The Wire wasn't afraid to be gentle while laying out a bleaker truth for its viewers, delivering one of the more satisfying finales in television history.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4065,The Wire,1,It's far more satisfying than the dismal end to The Sopranos and it is noticeable that there is nothing that would prevent HBO from making another season of The Wire.,VUDU,94%,97%,44
4066,The Wire,1,"Even if you came to series five cold, from a Wireless world, you'd have found plenty to enjoy: the way the dialogue is at once naturalistic and aphor-istic [and] the outstanding naturalism of the performances.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4067,The Wire,1,"Quite simply, it was the best television drama ever made, and if it's ever surpassed it won't be on this side of the Atlantic. British TV does not have the resources, the scriptwriters or the actors even to attempt something on this scale.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4068,The Wire,1,"The Wire amazes with its gritty attention to detail. It feels so damned real, and from Day One that's been both its blessing and its curse. You don't kick up your feet to watch. Nor do you feel at ease.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4069,The Wire,1,"The Wire is a programme that demands your full attention but eventually it repays you, and once it begins to weave its spell you'll find yourself, much like several of its characters, totally hooked and desperate for more.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4070,The Wire,1,"The Wire isn't the most accessible series. The show lays out a lot of plot strands, forcing the question: Where are we headed? Stick with it, though, and you'll see a remarkable tapestry.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4071,The Wire,1,"So much happened. At times it seemed too rushed, but ultimately it all came together as plots were hatched, schemes crumbled and truth and honesty took a major beating.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4072,The Wire,1,"The plots are labyrinthine and defy easy entry. The dialogue resonates with the lingua franca of the streets, so there's much that can't be accessed until viewers get used to the language.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4073,The Wire,1,The Wire avoids caricatures with pitch-perfect depictions of the criminals scrapping their way to the top of a bloody heap.,VUDU,94%,97%,44
4074,The Wire,1,It's great to once again be in the company of these amazing actors... And it's a pleasure to be treated to amazing writing that doesn't try to simplify things and/or pander.,VUDU,94%,97%,44
4075,The Wire,1,"This season, series creator David Simon has added an extra layer of interest by focusing on his newspaper roots. This season also is less complicated than past seasons.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4076,The Wire,1,"It's a tale less of crime and punishment than crime and survival... It all adds up to a message that requires a very precise rhythm, in script and performance, and from the first moments of this new season, The Wire is locked in.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4077,The Wire,1,"Led by a solid core of returning characters -- none true villains, none true heroes -- with important additions (and sad subtractions) each season, it's one of the best series of all time.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4078,The Wire,1,"""The Wire"" is unquestionably the best show on television.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4079,The Wire,1,"Amidst the rubble of a failed city, Simon created an engrossing human drama about the eternal struggle between aspiration and desperation, ambition and resignation, in other words, the fight for the American Dream.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4080,The Wire,0,"Season 5's mistakes-clunky plotting, false parallels, confused motivations-are violations of the realism the show promised.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4081,The Wire,1,"It's the best season of television's best show. So goodbye to The Wire, it's been a great run.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4082,The Wire,1,I'm praying that [David Simon's] fury at the Sun won't overwhelm his genius for storytelling.,VUDU,94%,97%,44
4083,The Wire,1,"Ultimately, the show doesn't even have a moustache-twirling villain. There are just people. David Simon and his brilliant cast and crew did everything in their power to depict these people are honestly and fairly as possible.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4084,The Wire,0,"Though interesting at times, the fictionalized account of The Baltimore Sun lacks the depth of the institutions depicted in seasons past.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4085,The Wire,1,"In a season filled with great performances, the menacing portrayal of Marlo Stanfield turned in by Hector is the best reason to watch season five.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4086,The Wire,1,"... if you're looking for new episodes of the best cop show on television, well, we won't say it. Enough is enough, right?",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4087,The Wire,1,"Creating a microcosm of a broken nation, The Wire remained, to the very last fade-out montage, as messy and often painful as life itself.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4088,The Wire,1,Among the many things that separate The Wire from other TV dramas is the way that creator David Simon eases into a season.,VUDU,94%,97%,44
4089,The Wire,1,This episode quickly reminds us of how completely believable and engrossing the world Simon has created is. Every moment feels genuine.,VUDU,94%,97%,44
4090,The Wire,1,"The dense mythology of HBO's The Wire, painstakingly created over five novelistic seasons, has enough drama packed inside to be easily spun out for the next five, ten, 15 years.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4091,The Wire,1,The show will go out as one of the medium's greatest.,VUDU,94%,97%,44
4092,The Wire,1,"The absence of gimmickry and the presence of respect for the story and the audience give The Wire organic advantages over nearly all other TV dramas, whether they deal with cops and crime or birds and bees.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4093,The Wire,1,"Some of the themes in The Wire may be generic (underpaid cops, newsroom politics), but the series achieves immense success in one vital regard for drama -- the feeling that we are in a real place.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4094,The Wire,1,"Based on the seven episodes previewed, it's every bit as cynical, riveting and brilliant as the four flights that preceded it -- a searing look at the decay of a major American city that puts most of what's on television to shame.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4095,The Wire,1,"It is as if, in a guilty fever, we dreamt up our own worst punishments-stories of the sort Joan Didion used to tell us about the princess caged in the consulate and the man with the candy leading the children into the sea.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4096,The Wire,1,"It is one of the most intimate and alarming depictions of urban America on television, and yet it's an invigorating and even exhilarating experience, each season a new Harry Potter book for adults.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4097,The Wire,1,The Wire certainly is Dickensian.,VUDU,94%,97%,44
4098,The Wire,1,"The fifth and final season may be the most overtly farcical, but only because things in this slightly fictionalized Baltimore have become, if you can imagine, worse than ever. When the going gets tough on The Wire, the tough get funny.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4099,The Wire,1,Simon can rest assured that he's created something unique that will last well beyond the confines of its prime time ratings prison.,VUDU,94%,97%,44
4100,The Wire,1,"If there's one problem with The Wire, it's that, five seasons in, too many beautifully realized characters fight for too little room - a gem of a complaint to have.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4101,The Wire,1,David Simon's sprawling epic of urban decay is as good as this startlingly brilliant show has ever been - and it has always been among TV's best.,VUDU,94%,97%,44
4102,The Wire,1,"Not exactly a Hallmark card, but one hell of an artistic achievement.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4103,The Wire,1,Fans of the show will not likely be disappointed. This new 10-episode season boasts the same high quality of production that this series has always exhibited.,VUDU,94%,97%,44
4104,The Wire,1,The odds are good that you have not yet watched the first four seasons of The Wire... and that means that I as TV critic have failed you. Mea culpa.,VUDU,94%,97%,44
4105,The Wire,1,"Once again, Simon does the impossible. He takes themes we've heard a million times - our politicians are corrupt, our schools are failing our kids, our newspapers are being raped by corporate overlords - and he gracefully, subtly realizes them onscreen.",VUDU,94%,97%,44
4106,The Wire,0,Simon so forces events in the improbable newspaper story line of an invented serial killer that he does serious damage to the credibility of the police drama.,VUDU,94%,97%,44
4107,True Detective,1,It's already a feat to say this might be Mahershala Ali's best acting craft. But what amazes me is how perfectly it swerves around three different timelines. Impressive storytelling. Full review in Spanish,VUDU,78%,74%,91

4112,True Detective,1,"I just wanted a moment when the characters caught their breath and didn't feel like they were part of an overly-scripted machine. Now, having said that, this is still engaging, dark, complex material, anchored by a great performance from Ali.",VUDU,78%,74%,91

4115,True Detective,1,"Fans will eat this season up, and for good reason. It's smart, it's intriguing, and there's a dreary atmosphere that can best be credited to director Jeremy Saulnier",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4116,True Detective,0,"The season had its moments, but it felt more like a vehicle for delivering a type of experience than a discrete story divided into eight installments. What's good about this show is almost entirely eclipsed by what doesn't work.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4117,True Detective,0,"The criteria by which Season 3 should be judged is whether Pizzolatto lived up to his aspirations as an investigator of human nature. Really, he made a mildly engaging muddle.",VUDU,78%,74%,91

4126,True Detective,1,"Season Three of True Detective doesn't have quite the pulling power of the first go-around, in which McConaughey's revelatory performance immediately jumped off the screen.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4127,True Detective,1,"Featuring a case that jumps around like a jack-rabbit, look like a return to form.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4128,True Detective,1,"""Time is a flat circle"" be damned - with Pizzolatto showing a bit more restraint, audiences get something straightforward, but filled with enough twists and turns to keep us on the edge of our seats.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4129,True Detective,1,"Ali's character, Detective Wayne Hays, a Vietnam vet, a loner with a suspicious nature, is another of Ali's indelible characterizations, an absolute must-see.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4130,True Detective,1,"True Detective's third season is progressing pretty nicely. The mystery is spooky and involving while not overly reliant on shocks and switchbacks, and it has enough emotional hooks to elevate it beyond the basic whodunnit.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4131,True Detective,1,"Ali's powerful performance is backed up by those of Carmen Ejogo, who plays his wife Amelia, and Stephen Dorff , who is his partner Roland.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4132,True Detective,1,Fans who have stuck around will be pleased to find that True Detective season three mostly returns to form.,VUDU,78%,74%,91
4133,True Detective,1,"Detailed, suggestive, just confusing enough, True Detective has made itself an active investigation once again.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4134,True Detective,1,Ali plays [Wayne] magnetically; you cannot look away.,VUDU,78%,74%,91
4135,True Detective,1,"From a spirit laden community centre to a woodland pedophile campsite to the dark interior of Hays' mind, it's a brooding gem.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4136,True Detective,1,"This third season of True Detective isn't contorting itself into season one, it's more nuanced and expansive in the ways it approaches masculinity.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4137,True Detective,1,"Exploring the grim certainty of battling time, Ali carries the show by subtly pushing against expectations, finding empathy in the murkiest darkness that True Detective has ever explored.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4138,True Detective,0,"The towering talent of Ali almost straightens out the third season of True Detective from its ultimately dull centrifugal swirl. Yet,[it's] is overwhelmed by... capricious leaps in time and thinly spread philosophical space",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4139,True Detective,1,"There's not that much new here, but the show is plenty entertaining and more than worth watching for Ali's performance alone.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4140,True Detective,0,"True Detective bills itself as something better, but really, it's just more of the same.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4141,True Detective,1,"Season three marks a return to form for True Detective, even if though it fails to reach the highs of its freshman effort.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4142,True Detective,1,"This is often a one-man show for Ali, sometimes wearing prosthetics to make him old, grey and suffering from dementia, and he is terrific in all three timelines.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4143,True Detective,1,"I remember having reservations about another True Detective season and those fears only being eased slightly when Ali was announced to star. If you shared my fears, please believe that Ali's arrival was a very good sign.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4144,True Detective,1,"In the end, this is a decent, serviceable thriller, nasty enough to give the impression of not flinching away from the darkest natures of its characters, and sufficiently gripping to ensure that viewers should keep on watching.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4145,True Detective,1,"The opening episodes are a success, thanks to Mahershala Ali, who always seems to have easy access to mysterious depths.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4146,True Detective,1,"One divisive second-season later, the series is back with a whole new set of characters, but a mystery that feels elemental. Time is a flat circle, after all.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4147,True Detective,1,"The first half of season 3 is promising, if a bit stiff, and anchored by Ali, who turns the Man Haunted by His Past into something a little different.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4148,True Detective,1,"STREAM IT, mostly for the performances of Ali and Ejogo.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4149,True Detective,1,"Whatever the outcome of the Purcell case, expect it to involve someone who simply cannot let go of what's come before - both in the context of the story's universe, as well as the larger narrative of the creative mind weaving the True Detective tale.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4150,True Detective,0,"Yet again ""True Detective,"" after a drawn-out hiatus, capitalizes heavily on atmosphere, artistry and the celebrity aura of its star players, at times focusing more emphatically on this garb than the integrity of its narrative skeleton.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4151,True Detective,1,"Because that actor is Mashershala Ali, it's a remarkable tour de force, keeping three balls in the air at once, in three eras, adjusting his performance in each one, based on what he's learned since.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4152,True Detective,0,True Detective falls prey to a slightly milder case of misogyny than afflicted it in season one.,VUDU,78%,74%,91
4153,True Detective,1,What made True Detective special was the haze of strangeness that hung about it like a supernatural mist. Let us join hands and mouth a ritualistic prayer in the hope that TD3 is every bit as weird and quietly deranged.,VUDU,78%,74%,91
4154,True Detective,0,"It is neither as raw and gripping as the series' rookie season nor as structurally unsound as its second. It is good, not great.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4155,True Detective,1,"What truly makes this chapter stand out is its willingness is take a step back to revel in what makes these characters - specifically Ali's - tick. It's not only a haunting mystery, but also a look at one man's struggle to find meaning in himself.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4156,True Detective,1,Saulnier doesn't entirely harken back to the swampy and sweaty mood of the first season but what he brings feels a bit closer to what once made True Detective great.,VUDU,78%,74%,91
4157,True Detective,1,Given the cryptic and slow burning nature of the show - creator Nic Pizzolatto and co. are big on holding back key details until the right moment.,VUDU,78%,74%,91
4158,True Detective,1,"The effect of racial stereotypes on the carriage of justice is also examined. In this way the show succeeds in categories that early seasons couldn't even compete in, and categorically improves its canon.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4159,True Detective,1,True Detective season 3 establishes its three timelines and the central facts of the case with a clever breathlessness.,VUDU,78%,74%,91
4160,True Detective,0,"True Detective Season 3 is a little more workmanlike and less baroque, perhaps too eager to prove that it can tell a legible story again.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4161,True Detective,1,"If the season 3 premiere is any indication, we're in for jaw-dropping twists, genuinely crushing moments, and a truly sinister tale.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4162,True Detective,1,"Season three marks a quasi-return to safety, albeit one that's needlessly more complicated and predictably dour.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4163,True Detective,0,"While I appreciate Mahershala Ali's solid performance and the technical excellence of this gorgeous production, there is no sense of urgency or connection. Everyone is sleep walking through the case.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4164,True Detective,1,"Almost four years after the underwhelming second season, True Detective has returned-and it blessedly resembles the original season.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4165,True Detective,0,"Ali's performance is an example of what the show can be, but the third season as a whole remains as a disappointing reminder of what was.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4166,True Detective,1,"True Detective has returned to its essence, just not with the same dazzling, controversial force.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4167,True Detective,1,"It's an ambitious and imperfect work, beautiful and corny, believable and less believable by turns. I recommend it, with advisories.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4168,True Detective,1,This is a script determinedly dedicated to the slow reveal. But it is also one alive with passion and a mordant wit.,VUDU,78%,74%,91
4169,True Detective,1,"Despite the shadowy distractions, ""True Detective"" is a solid procedural led by a faceted leading performance.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4170,True Detective,1,"What elevates it are the brooding atmosphere and Ali's magnetic performance, from his dogged pursuit of the facts in his younger days to his convincing vulnerability in his elderly ones.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4171,True Detective,0,"What ultimately sinks this season is the dull sameness of it all... nearly every scene has the same rhythm and pacing, often centered on two or three people conferring solemnly in hushed voices; the show could be titled Men Mumbling About Crimes.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4172,True Detective,1,"Three seasons in, it's clear what ""True Detective"" is: a platinum-cast anthology of moody crime stories in which familiar cops with familiar demons chase familiar devils.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4173,True Detective,0,"The third season of True Detective plays to the first season's strengths, but it also feels like an admission of defeat.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4174,True Detective,0,"I wondered what I would think if neither of the previous seasons had existed, and I realized-I probably wouldn't be thinking about it at all.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4175,True Detective,0,"It's clear that Pizzolotto still thinks like a novelist... His show struggles to find its sweet spot as a work of television, maybe because it's conceived with a pace and style that is better suited to the page.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4176,True Detective,1,These efforts pay off in a solid third season whose structure and style hew close to those of the first.,VUDU,78%,74%,91
4177,True Detective,1,"Season 3 is absolutely better than a host of the artsy and moody mystery dramas that sprang up in True Detective's wake, and it runs (flat) circles around the over-stuffed sophomore season.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4178,True Detective,1,Ali's performance as old man crumbling as the loss of his vast intelligence accelerates is wrenching. The old-age makeup is the best this viewer has ever seen and is utterly convincing.,VUDU,78%,74%,91
4179,True Detective,1,"True Detective season 3 is a vast improvement over season 2, but it never quite matches the strength and memorability of season 1",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4180,True Detective,1,"Season three of the time-jumping, philosophically inclined series repeats season one's tricks, but gets a boost from its new leading man.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4181,True Detective,1,"Ultimately, Season 3 is successful in reproducing the noble yet macabre journeys that feature in 1 and 2, while evolving itself in structure and tone.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4182,True Detective,1,"Ali is breathtaking, giving us a trifecta of performances that grow increasingly complex with each passing decade.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4183,True Detective,1,"Ali's performance is the only thing disguising how rote this all feels, and how much the series keeps repeating itself, within seasons as well as across them.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4184,True Detective,1,True Detective gets back on track.,VUDU,78%,74%,91
4185,True Detective,0,"The new True Detective is faintly pretentious, manageably ridiculous, and dull.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4186,True Detective,1,"Thankfully the third marks a return to absorbing, compelling form for True Detective.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4187,True Detective,1,"The right lessons have been learned from the show's past, as outstanding performances both ground and augment the third season's solid, even affecting crime story.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4188,True Detective,1,This is addictive television.,VUDU,78%,74%,91
4189,True Detective,0,This season's attempt to bring back the old True Detective magic also feels a bit stale.,VUDU,78%,74%,91
4190,True Detective,1,"Where season three most improves upon the seasons preceding it, though, is in how it crystallizes something True Detective has always been about.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4191,True Detective,1,"It's just a well-made, well-acted, intelligently plotted, thematically rich mystery show. In 2019, that's both plenty and not enough.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4192,True Detective,1,"Tightly directed... and plotted, and with a performance at its center that steers away from calling attention to itself, the new ""True Detective"" transcends hype and amounts to 2019's first pleasant small-screen surprise.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4193,True Detective,1,"The premiere episodes show a lot of promise plotwise, teasing out a season that gets to the uniquely spooky roots that hooked audiences in the first go-round. If the devil really has come to Arkansas, we're happy to fall under his spell.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4194,True Detective,1,What sets this season of True Detective apart from either of the previous runs is that the crime here is not merely being investigated as much as it is being unraveled.,VUDU,78%,74%,91
4195,True Detective,1,"At the very least, the new True Detective season is a three-tiered showcase for Mahershala Ali, who stays consistently mesmerizing even if the mystery around him does not.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4196,True Detective,1,"The show is good again and a near perfect copy of the show's creative height. The thing is, what we want out of our television shows has changed quite a bit in five years.",VUDU,78%,74%,91
4197,True Detective,1,The complexities in Wayne and Amelia's relationship - how they love and torment each other - is where the show really takes hold.,VUDU,78%,74%,91
4198,Doom Patrol,1,"This is not a seven episode season for anyone who craves convention. At times, the plot sequencing can feel chaotic, lurching. But tonally, Doom Patrol opens up boxes that offer opportunities rarely taken.",VUDU,97%,75%,10
4199,Doom Patrol,1,[I]t gives the viewers something that approaches wonderful.,VUDU,97%,75%,10
4200,Doom Patrol,1,"If that base remains stable enough, and the occasional (or not-so-occasional) addition of weird new spices to the blend remains exciting, Doom Patrol can keep rainy-day daydreaming as long as it likes.",VUDU,97%,75%,10
4201,Doom Patrol,1,"Doom Patrol's third season is off to a strong start. A few parts of each episode feel a bit slow, but overall, the first three episodes set the stage for another wild ride that I am more than ready to take.",VUDU,97%,75%,10
4202,Doom Patrol,1,"Michelle Gomez's arrival on Doom Patrol is pitch-perfect, just like she is.",VUDU,97%,75%,10
4203,Doom Patrol,1,"I'm giving this a fresh tomato because of the strong cast, and that I still haven't seen the 2nd half of the season. But this show seems like it's going in circles...",VUDU,97%,75%,10
4204,Doom Patrol,1,Doom Patrol has learned the lesson that pathos not need require a morose tone. The show is at its finest when these flawed and funny people are allowed to be uproarious even when they're in pain.,VUDU,97%,75%,10
4205,Doom Patrol,1,"Season 3 continues this trend, with hilariously weird moments seamlessly giving way to internalized therapy sessions you can't find anywhere else in the genre.",VUDU,97%,75%,10
4206,Doom Patrol,1,The most absurd season yet -- in a really good way.,VUDU,97%,75%,10
4207,Doom Patrol,1,Television's best superhero show just keeps getting better.,VUDU,97%,75%,10
4208,Banshee,1,"With ""Requiem"", Banshee doesn't go out like the funeral procession its title suggests it would: but it's that final twist of optimism that seals everything neatly into place, a final hour that is more than a fitting farewell to a memorable series.",VUDU,90%,90%,11
4209,Banshee,1,Banshee isn't fooling anyone. It is what it is. [Full Review in Spanish],VUDU,90%,90%,11
4210,Banshee,1,"We're back in the town that stay trying to replace Gotham City as the hardest place on Earth - Banshee, Pennsylvania.",VUDU,90%,90%,11
4211,Banshee,1,"At this point, I don't know where this show is going or what kind of ending we can expect, and that just makes me more excited.",VUDU,90%,90%,11
4212,Banshee,1,"As dark and nasty and psychologically tormented as Banshee has always been, it's also been fun on some level, and it's incredibly hard to have fun playing in this particular sandbox.",VUDU,90%,90%,11
4213,Banshee,1,The series remains the best action show on TV by far.,VUDU,90%,90%,11
4214,Banshee,1,"Banshee is the pulpiest series on television right now, and it's certainly the pulpiest series that's been on television in quite some time.",VUDU,90%,90%,11
4215,Banshee,1,It isn't long though before you start remembering how much you enjoy these characters,VUDU,90%,90%,11
4216,Banshee,1,"If there's one thing Banshee has always been, it's a show that does everything on its own terms, and that includes its ending.",VUDU,90%,90%,11
4217,Banshee,1,"While we expect shows to make bold moves as they near the conclusion, Banshee's shift as displayed here took some legitimate gumption.",VUDU,90%,90%,11
4218,Banshee,1,"Banshee's story is full of twists and unexpected connections, as well as its telltale brutal violence. In a sick streak of creativity, the show continues to find new, gruesome ways to kill people.",VUDU,90%,90%,11
4219,Superman & Lois,1,"Season 2 remains engaging thanks to its teenage relationships and family melodrama, courtesy of Clark Kents’ civilian neighbors, the Cushings. Perhaps without meaning to, the series becomes about the ripple effects of living in a world of superheroes.",VUDU,86%,82%,3
4220,Superman & Lois,1,"The premiere had everything I love about the show, including the stunning visuals, so it will be fun to watch where the series goes next.",VUDU,86%,82%,3
4221,Superman & Lois,1,Season 2 of Superman and Lois deals with the direct fallout from Season 1 whilst testing Superman's allegiance to the World versus his allegiance to the USA.,VUDU,86%,82%,3
4222,The Leftovers,1,"No matter how you feel about the actual subject matter, the performances and teleplays were transcendent.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4223,The Leftovers,1,"Each episode is a reawakening, a daring reorientation of characters or setting, and they're all building towards something world-changing.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4224,The Leftovers,1,The show ultimately connects the Departure to the experience of loss and grief - religion does not so much explain the mysteries of life as provide a framework for living within them.,VUDU,91%,90%,46
4225,The Leftovers,1,"It has been one of the most intense emotional experiences of the last years on television. And possibly, the best series of recent times. It leaves when we need it most. [Full Review in Spanish]",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4226,The Leftovers,1,"It isn't an easy watch. If you're struggling with grief, choose something else. For everyone else, The Leftovers is one of the decade's best shows and definitely deserves repeat viewing.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4227,The Leftovers,1,"Pillar saints, sacrificial goats, four horsewomen of the Apocalypse, resurrections, miracles - it's all here.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4228,The Leftovers,1,"Rather, the show is coming full circle, proving to be the same series it has always been. That doesn't make for a bad final run of episodes, just a flawed one.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4229,The Leftovers,1,"The final season of the series was goddamn extraordinary, unbelievably rich and nuanced, and left such a lasting impression, I thought about it for months afterward.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4230,The Leftovers,1,This spiritually shaking psychological drama promises more existential crises than enlightened answers.,VUDU,91%,90%,46
4231,The Leftovers,1,The Leftovers is one of our most intensely compassionate hours of television.,VUDU,91%,90%,46
4232,The Leftovers,1,"The third and final season is one for the ages, capping off an utterly unique time-tripping story about the end of the world.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4233,The Leftovers,1,It beautifully ties up the themes and the character's journeys. [Full review in Portuguese.],VUDU,91%,90%,46
4234,The Leftovers,1,"The Leftovers cemented its legacy as one of the best TV shows of all time with a third and final season filled with humor, heartache, and unique personalized madness that was both baffling and relatable.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4235,The Leftovers,1,An obituary of one of the greatest shows in the history of TV.,VUDU,91%,90%,46
4236,The Leftovers,1,"Nora's story is recognizable to anyone who's suffered trauma. It reflects a certain fantasy, even.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4237,The Leftovers,1,"As the show broadened geographically it did the same tonally, newly injected with a kind of mordant humor as its characters began to give in to rather than resist its grand, apocalyptic currents.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4238,The Leftovers,1,Keep the show near you; it's a keeper that will endure.,VUDU,91%,90%,46
4239,The Leftovers,1,"In an era of TV tough guys, Kevin is fascinatingly atypical.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4240,The Leftovers,1,"It may well be that in the end, as in Lost, there are just too many stray threads to tie up. But whether or not the makers manage to nail the landing, it's quite the routine.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4241,The Leftovers,1,"If you don't have religion, you should at least have The Leftovers.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4242,The Leftovers,1,"It is the most audacious hour on television, going places other shows wouldn't dare tread, and yet every risk is rewarded with aplomb.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4243,The Leftovers,1,The Leftovers miraculously turns that ambiguity into its greatest accomplishment.,VUDU,91%,90%,46
4244,The Leftovers,1,"The final season also pulls off another unexpected tonal shift, with several whimsical, absurd and laugh-out-loud moments even as it aches with sadness.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4245,The Leftovers,0,It should feel like Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? It actually feels like The Real Housewives of New Jersey.,VUDU,91%,90%,46
4246,The Leftovers,1,"The Leftovers will leave us with answers to the questions and puzzles it has been posing, and will fill in the gaps and spaces that beg to be closed. Real life imparts little in the way of such soothing conclusion upon the bereft.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4247,The Leftovers,1,The final season steers the narrative and the viewing faithful toward something more rewarding than the promise of an answer.,VUDU,91%,90%,46
4248,The Leftovers,1,"As gonzo as the new season is, it never loses touch with what the show is about: coping with unbearable loss.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4249,The Leftovers,1,"I'm not a person who tosses around the word ""awesome"" the way it's usually used today -- which is to say as a synonym for ""very good"" or ""cool."" No, when I say The Leftovers is awesome, this is what I mean: It fills me with awe.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4250,The Leftovers,1,"There's still something about this program that can't be put into words. There's something almost religious about in the way you just need to see it, feel it, and believe.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4251,The Leftovers,1,The Leftovers is a tremendous iceberg of a show on which one could write endlessly about just one or two calving chunks of interest and come nowhere near delving into even a small portion of what lurks underneath.,VUDU,91%,90%,46
4252,The Leftovers,1,"As these dirty-faced angels prepare to face their maybe indifferent, possibly nonexistent maker, Lindelof and Perrotta wisely break them off into single-character-focused episodes, which has always been the show's most effective method.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4253,The Leftovers,1,"The Leftovers is about the inability to process huge, traumatic events because you lack a frame of reference for them - which makes it feel very much like a series that has found its moment in history.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4254,The Leftovers,1,"Between the prospect of a definitive ending, the looming fear of catastrophe, and the continually exceptional performances, it's bravura television that somehow follows the model of earlier seasons while subverting expectations.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4255,The Leftovers,1,"As a barely watched and short-lived HBO drama, The Leftovers doesn't have anyone or anything to answer for. But if these final episodes are any indication, more shows should have that luxury and that freedom.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4256,The Leftovers,1,"Returning this week for a third and final season, the work of several master storytellers, is HBO's The Leftovers, and if you have never seen it, try dipping in just to get a feel of how far TV drama has travelled in the past decade.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4257,The Leftovers,1,"Like a good millennialist cult, The Leftovers grasps an outlandish idea with absolute emotional commitment: The performances in this final run are spectacular throughout, but especially Ms. Coon's and Mr. Theroux's.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4258,The Leftovers,1,But this miraculous series masterfully holds ambiguity and extremely robust storytelling in the same generous bear hug.,VUDU,91%,90%,46
4259,The Leftovers,1,"I waited a long time for The Leftovers Season 3, and I can tell you that the show does not disappoint; it's going out at the height of its powers.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4260,The Leftovers,1,"A preview of seven episodes (encompassing all but the finale) finds the series more assured and purposeful -- steadfastly moving toward something, whatever that might be, as opposed to away from the inexplicable event that set the story in motion.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4261,The Leftovers,1,"on top of the phenomenal performances, stellar narrative structure, and compelling/emotionally devastating writing, the show's thematic relevance all but secures it a lauded place in TV history. Buckle up, folks-this is one hell of a sendoff.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4262,The Leftovers,1,"Exciting, ambitious, baffling and not always tethered to coherent storytelling, The Leftovers is one of TV's best series.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4263,The Leftovers,1,"I've moved past depression and into acceptance when it comes to this series, but I'm still going to miss it when it's gone.",VUDU,91%,90%,46
4264,The Leftovers,1,A satisfying final season to TV's most ambitious drama.,VUDU,91%,90%,46
4265,The Leftovers,1,"The Leftovers Season 3 is outstanding. It takes Season 2 and masterfully builds upon the characters' emotional backgrounds, giving them more depth and taking their journeys to stunning, unpredictable places with great reward.",VUDU,91%,90%,46

4320,Rick and Morty,1,"As season openers go, this is a really solid entry from Rick and Morty. Nimbus is an instantly memorable character and the Morty storyline is a reminder that Morty is capable of having hilarious adventures without Rick's direct involvement.",VUDU,94%,87%,22
4321,Rick and Morty,1,"Thanks to the guidance of creators Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland, the fifth season continues to develop while it blows our minds with new universes, timelines and TV-MA situations, making it more than just a sci-fi toon with the occasional dick joke.",VUDU,94%,87%,22
4322,Rick and Morty,1,"A tiny, almost throwaway plot detail can mutate into a gloriously surreal digression that threatens to overwhelm the main narrative. You find this in the best Simpsons episodes too, but I've rarely seen it done with more outrageous verve than it is here.",VUDU,94%,87%,22

4329,Rick and Morty,1,"Rick and Morty persists not only for its inversion of sci-fi tropes, clever pop culture riffing and raw hilarity. It continues to hold our interest in a way few shows do because it knows we are all capable of great and terrible things.",VUDU,94%,87%,22
4330,Rick and Morty,1,"If ""Rick and Morty"" wants to toss in some more serialized stuff into Season 5 instead of trying to constantly outdo itself, that might be a way to keep this early momentum going.",VUDU,94%,87%,22

4352,The White Lotus,0,"What's lifted up are all of the critiques of sexism, racism, and classism. What's cancelled are the sources of these critiques, which are predominately POCs. And what's preserved is the hetero white male dominance of capitalism.",VUDU,89%,77%,93
4353,The White Lotus,1,"Everyone in it is so good it's almost invidious to single out special performances. But the star turn has to be Bartlett as resort manager Armond, a recovering alcoholic and drug addict who becomes deliciously, hilariously, apocalyptically unstuck.",VUDU,89%,77%,93
4354,The White Lotus,1,The 'eat the rich' genre is pleasurable because it plays into our fantasies of watching the obscenely wealthy get their comeuppance. The White Lotus takes this a step further by having its rich cannibalise themselves.,VUDU,89%,77%,93

4365,The White Lotus,1,"Dreadful rich people make for brilliant TV, but it is rare to see their privileges and prejudices skewered with such relentless precision. White's characters can be monstrous, but they are so carefully wrought that they also feel painfully human.",VUDU,89%,77%,93

4537,The Boys,1,"Season 3 of The Boys shows it's not running out of superhero serum anytime soon. Instead, it covers even more ground, bulging with gags, topical issues and ludicrous action sequences to create the most potently entertaining, eye-popping cocktail.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4538,The Boys,1,The Boys‘ third season is the most balanced to date and had me hooked from the first episode to the last and will likely have you all hoping the fourth comes sooner than later.,VUDU,93%,85%,77
4539,The Boys,1,"The Boys is back for a depraved and pointed Season 3 as the superhero series expands its scope and history for a bloodier, more poignant story.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4540,The Boys,1,"“The Boys” is consistently entertaining, but it could be so much stronger. For the first time, it almost seems scared to really unleash its true power",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4541,The Boys,1,"The Boys Season 3 balances gore and irreverent, dark humor with surprising poignancy and depth. Said gore and boundary-pushing scenes never feel forced or gratuitous; they fit the show’s tone.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4542,The Boys,1,"The third season of The Boys delivers in spades. It’s got more violence, more random musical numbers, more heartbreaking moments of despair, and more to say about the state of today’s affairs.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4543,The Boys,1,"If The Boys wants to avoid becoming the very machine it’s mocking, it needs to drive its social commentary home and bring the Butcher v Homelander feud to some sort of irreversible conclusion.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4544,The Boys,1,"The rollicking third season features more sex, drugs, lies, and carnage as the body count rises and the Boys figure out their next move.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4545,The Boys,1,"Season 3 of the crazy superhero satire is more violent, funnier, and darker than ever before. And it features some unexpected plot twists and crazy performances.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4546,The Boys,1,"It's still offensive, depraved, obscene and ridiculously violent. I loved it from start to finish... Each episode is a feast of twists, surprises, and intrigue that had me mercilessly glued to it, from the very first sequence. Full review in Spanish.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4547,The Boys,1,This show is beyond nuts.,VUDU,93%,85%,77
4548,The Boys,1,"Many may find that The Boys is retreading already well-worn territory. However, I think there is still plenty of life left in The Boys, and a depressingly endless amount of American hypocrisy and depravity to skewer.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4549,The Boys,1,"The Boys continues to be one of the best series on television. Its storytelling, visual effects, one-in-a-million actors, and non-conventional humor continue to prove why the series is a fan favorite.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4550,The Boys,1,"If this season makes us feel more squeamish, that may be for reasons other than the exploding victims... Perhaps it's because the show has gotten very good at reminding us that our nation's reality is not so far removed from the one it depicts.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4551,The Boys,1,"I found my self saying ""Oh My God"" more than I think I ever had. This show is absolutely demented… and Season Three is all the better for it.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4552,The Boys,1,"It’s brash. It’s bloody. And if the boys wanna fight, you better let ‘em.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4553,The Boys,1,"It’s a sturdily built season, but it might make you miss the show at its full strength.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4554,The Boys,1,The emotional connections makes all the ultra-violence that much easier to stomach.,VUDU,93%,85%,77
4555,The Boys,1,The Boys third season is a terrific satirical look at our world. But I am unsure if I was ready to witness it right now.,VUDU,93%,85%,77
4556,The Boys,1,"“The Boys” returns for a third season of head-popping gore, dark humor and psychotic superheroes — and it’s a rollicking ride.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4557,The Boys,1,"Crammed but not stale, “The Boys” retains its relentless style and continues to deliver a needed black eye to a genre that refuses to let go of our collective pop culture.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4558,The Boys,1,"...feels like some of the most adept social satire of the moment. In part, that’s because society at large has just gotten so much worse that mildly watered-down Garth Ennis no longer feels much like humorous exaggeration.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4559,The Boys,1,The Boys Season Three gives us yet another crucial representation of current American society and its struggle to become whole amidst all of the blatant untruths and bigotry that has permeated it since its origin.,VUDU,93%,85%,77
4560,The Boys,0,"Its bleak viewing experience might appeal to some audiences, but it’s likely to leave more than a few viewers wishing the entire cast of characters would just be put out of their misery.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4561,The Boys,1,Antony Starr (Homelander) steals every scene he's in.,VUDU,93%,85%,77
4562,The Boys,1,It’s tough to top the absurdity of the real world we live in but The Boys continues to reflect it back at us with a merciless accuracy. Sometimes it can hit too close to home / some of us haven't had enough distance from the real inspiring events.,VUDU,93%,85%,77
4563,The Boys,1,"The Boys remains creatively fearless and, for those with the stomach for it, a great deal of fun. As creative combinations go, like Homelander, that one-two punch looks pretty near unstoppable.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4564,The Boys,1,"What The Boys does very well is take something ripe for parody and constantly escalate, much to the delight of its audience.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4565,The Boys,1,"The Boys might be showing some cracks in its smart satire foundation, but there’s still plenty to enjoy in this crazy, bloody ride.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4566,The Boys,1,"The way The Boys captures how futile the struggle to do and be good can feel sometimes, when the systems in place seem like they can never be fixed for the better, gives it a certain relevance to today that frankly it’d be nice to ignore.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4567,The Boys,1,Amazon’s superhero satire reminds us to be careful who we call a hero.,VUDU,93%,85%,77
4568,The Boys,1,"Decapitations, drama and darkness await audiences in The Boys season 3.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4569,The Boys,1,"The third season of The Boys is an insane, blood-soaked, and dick-filled journey into a twisted world where the superheroes are just as corrupt and monstrous as the government agencies that puppeteer them...",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4570,The Boys,0,The series’ ideology feels increasingly hollow.,VUDU,93%,85%,77
4571,The Boys,1,"In a show packed with gratuitous violence, some of the deepest cuts are emotional.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4572,The Boys,1,I still can’t believe what I saw – and I am very much enjoying the feeling.,VUDU,93%,85%,77
4573,The Boys,1,"As gleefully brutal as ever, with (slightly) more heart.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4574,The Boys,1,"Spitting in the face of comic book genre fatigue, this third season goes further than expected, indulging in graphic violence and sexuality, showcasing an unafraid mentality in its tackling of issues and thematics.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4575,The Boys,1,The words 'twisted' and 'in your face' barely touch what The Boys Season 3 attempts. This is superhero shock art.,VUDU,93%,85%,77
4576,The Boys,1,"The series has always been terrific at reflecting trends in the real world, its emphasis on the role of social media, branding, and celebrity in the modern world spot on from start to finish.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4577,The Boys,1,"The DNA that has made The Boys both a critical and ratings success is all there in season three – the violence, the gore, the deep commentary on our current political and media landscapes . . .",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4578,The Boys,1,"With this raging third season, 'The Boys' reiterates itself as one of the best original series on Amazon Prime Video. [Full review in Spanish]",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4579,The Boys,1,"The entire season is a lean, mean stomach-wrenching machine that pushes the limits at every turn and is wickedly accentuated by scathing social commentary.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4580,The Boys,1,"This season is chaotic, unhinged, and shocking. Antony Starr is on another level, as Homelander continues down his rage-filled path. The addition of Jenson Ackles as Soldier Boy is perfect, and this series continues to perfectly balance humor with action.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4581,The Boys,1,"The Boys Season 3 isn’t quite as shockingly powerful as Season 2 — there’s no topping Stormfront, apparently — but what the show lacks in political satire it makes up for with nuanced character development.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4582,The Boys,1,"S3 isn’t afraid to take things too far, and aims to make fans uncomfortable yet thoroughly entertained. The balance of seriousness, violence, humor, sex, grotesque, loving moments, and completely new elements–is a hit",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4583,The Boys,1,Thanks to the final 2 episodes - which are very strong - Season 3 is definitely worth your time. But the first 5 episodes are very unfocused. Great storylines for the female characters. But Antony Starr is once again what really makes this show shine.,VUDU,93%,85%,77
4584,The Boys,1,"The acting and characterization is top-notch, and the gory fight scenes remain thrilling. While the satire is a downgrade in sharpness from Season 2, the story remains worth watching.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4585,The Boys,1,"From the capable cast, the wonderful writing, and the well-crafted set and costume design (just to name a few things), The Boys continues to fire on all cylinders.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4586,The Boys,0,"Three seasons in, the gag is starting to grow a bit old, as the satire gets weaker and more toothless and more characters vie for our attention while traveling down familiar roads.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4587,The Boys,1,"The Boys season 3 is pitch-perfect satire, and the wildest season yet.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4588,The Boys,1,"The Boys knows to get the groove back by introducing some very violent or very sexual scene (sometimes both at the same time), (...) but maybe it's starting to reach the point of losing the element of surprise. [Full review in Spanish]",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4589,The Boys,1,"Through it all, the moral murkiness and messy consequences are never less than compelling in a season that blurs the line between the good guys and the bad guys more than ever before.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4590,The Boys,1,"Without giving too much away at this stage, season three just takes everything you love about The Boys and ramps it up ten-fold.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4591,The Boys,1,"The Boys season 3 premiere episodes are substantial, but they also bring back the trademark style of the show’s fun and lighthearted vibes that make it so enjoyable to watch.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4592,The Boys,1,"The layers of this rotten onion unfurl themselves, and even after all the shock wears off, one can appreciate this show for being, on a higher level, cultural critique even outside of the superhero realm.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4593,The Boys,1,"Kripke successfully maintains the series’ high caliber consistency with season three. “The Boys” continues its streak of anarchic energy, sardonic humor, and self-indulgence made all the more entertaining by its bursts of extreme gonzo violence.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4594,The Boys,1,"With a slew of gripping Supe showdowns, a biting social commentary and even more compelling character arcs, Prime Video’s tentpole show keeps going from strength to strength, proving to be one of the most bold and creative superhero streaming titles.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4595,The Boys,1,"The Boys Season 3 is taking it up a notch, in a way that feels almost too much at times and not nearly enough at others. In other words, The Boys Season 3 is very much The Boys and the show isn’t making any apologies for it, not that it has before.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4596,The Boys,1,Amazon Studios has obviously given the production a budget worthy of creating gory/bloody masterpieces.,VUDU,93%,85%,77
4597,The Boys,1,"“The Boys” is a black comedy, an action extravaganza, and a vicious editorial all rolled under the same cape.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4598,The Boys,1,Executive producer Eric Kripke and the show’s writers find new and inventive ways to freak us out.,VUDU,93%,85%,77
4599,The Boys,1,"The Boys season 3 does what the Prime Video show does best, but pales in comparison to the tightly wound and exciting narrative arc from season 2.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4600,The Boys,1,"Quibbles aside, I’m glad that as long as we must live in Marvel’s Cinematic Universe, The Boys offers an oasis for everyone who wishes we didn’t.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4601,The Boys,1,The Boys season 3 is back doing what it does best – balancing shock and gore with moving character development.,VUDU,93%,85%,77
4602,The Boys,1,"From the get-go, it’s clear that <I>The Boys</I> season 3 isn’t content to rest on its laurels and bask in the glow of its well-received second outing. The rubber meets the road quickly and loudly.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4603,The Boys,1,"The Boys as a TV show is entering a rare territory, one where it has staked its own claim with the property and seems poised to exceed its source material in many ways. The Boys TV series has found where it can improve on its source, and it's done that.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4604,The Boys,1,"With its third season, The Boys gives the middle finger to the rest of the streaming content out there and firmly establishes itself as one of the best shows on TV... comic book or otherwise.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4605,The Boys,1,Don't let the calm status quo that opens the new season of Amazon's gonzo anti-superhero series fool you: it's a dizzying spectacle of gore and grim humor.,VUDU,93%,85%,77
4606,The Boys,1,"The Boys season 3 is bigger, bloodier, and more political than ever before. It is completely bonkers and filled with jaw dropping moments, shocking twists, and pure insanity. It doesn’t get much better than this.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4607,The Boys,1,"An expansive exploration of power and what it means to have it. That theme amplifies quite a few character arcs, but Annie and Kimiko's journeys prove to be the Season 3 standouts.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4608,The Boys,1,"The Boys remains the most depraved and delightfully unhinged series on TV, and while it tries to cram a little too much in, season 3 is a must-see and a great platform for the phenomenal Jensen Ackles to steal the show as Soldier Boy.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4609,The Boys,1,"In some ways, by the end of the penis & cameo season, the purpose of the season (other than filling the catalog with interesting, quirky, crazy episodes) is unclear and perhaps a bit frustrating.",VUDU,93%,85%,77
4610,The Old Man,1,"It’s a simple cat-and-mouse premise, and the motivations are almost beside the point. The Old Man is less about the twists and turns of the spy genre and more of a showcase for Bridges and Lithgow, who are as good as they always are.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4611,The Old Man,1,Nice to see Jeff Bridges in a vehicle that deserves him.,VUDU,94%,86%,34
4612,The Old Man,1,"There is plenty of tension, but the real pleasure here is watching an old pro allowed to just be in front of the camera and remind us how it’s done.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4613,The Old Man,0,"The veteran actor does nuanced work as usual, but the FX series takes too many ridiculous turns.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4614,The Old Man,1,"The Old Man is more captivating when dealing with universal real-world concerns than with its spy stuff, no matter that its slam-bang action is crisp and its twists and turns are energized.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4615,The Old Man,1,"With danger always lurking, Bridges convinces us that underestimating this well-seasoned spy has deadly consequences, while the terrific Brenneman startles us.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4616,The Old Man,1,"In the early going, The Old Man seems like a skilled but predictable shoot-'em-up... But as it unfolds, like an onion shedding bloody skins, it's apparent that every character has secrets and practically nothing is as it seems.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4617,The Old Man,1,"A bold, wise series, with a knockout performance from Bridges leading the way.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4618,The Old Man,1,Sometimes a series is so breathtaking and complex and smart that it blows your mind. FX’S The Old Man is one of them.,VUDU,94%,86%,34
4619,The Old Man,1,"Jeff Bridges is fantastic in The Old Man, as is John Lithgow. It’s a show that promises to parse what it means to become old, what’s lost, and also what is never, ever forgotten.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4620,The Old Man,1,"On some level, The Old Man feels keenly aware of its limitations. Wisely, the series leans into the skill and grace of its cast, which also includes Amy Brenneman and Alia Shawkat in pivotal roles that grow more complicated as the show progresses.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4621,The Old Man,1,"The spy genre is so well worn one would think there's not much new to be done, but The Old Man largely confounds those expectations, thanks to the stellar combination of Jeff Bridges and John Lithgow.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4622,The Old Man,1,"Alas, you will get a sometimes frustrating story line that’s both complicated and, in some ways, simplistic at the same time... The actors, though, make it all worthwhile. In their hands, it’s a contemplative and always watchable take on the past.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4623,The Old Man,1,"Much of the show’s success comes down to Bridges, who anchors a rickety character visibly battered by the past yet able to shapeshift in the present.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4624,The Old Man,1,"The Old Man delivers predictable spy sub-plots, but its character study of aging agents caught up in moral quandaries proves fascinating.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4625,The Old Man,1,"It’s Bridges’ show. When the story leaves him for too long, you itch for his return.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4626,The Old Man,1,"Bridges lends grain and texture to a role that could too easily be a geriatric Ethan Hunt: Chase may be close to infallible, but he also gets meaningfully frustrated and weary.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4627,The Old Man,1,There’s lots here to satisfy action fans that are above all craving an adrenaline jolt. The Old Man has some of the most gruesome and distinctly shot fight scenes since Taken.,VUDU,94%,86%,34
4628,The Old Man,1,"What makes this... more than just another boomer action-adventure epic is its interrogation of the selfish, destructive, and self-righteous Chase’s claim to heroism.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4629,The Old Man,1,"The Old Man, like an old man, is best when it ambles with a contemplative pace.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4630,The Old Man,1,It’s that intentional space The Old Man gives to that story that transforms the series into a must-watch event.,VUDU,94%,86%,34
4631,The Old Man,1,"“The Old Man” wants you to feel the pain of both an unclean conscience and a fight to the death. One way or another, everyone here gets dirty.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4632,The Old Man,1,"It offers exactly what the poster promises, in two excellent performances from Bridges and Lithgow, and offers a bonus in some gripping close-quarters combat sequences. But the story itself feels like an afterthought.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4633,The Old Man,1,"“The Old Man” will travel down many different roads, with surprises and revelations lurking around every corner. Be sure to enjoy the ride.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4634,The Old Man,1,The filmmakers of “The Old Man” have crafted a dazzlingly intense dramatic thriller that ranks up there with the best TV of the year so far.,VUDU,94%,86%,34
4635,The Old Man,1,"There's an uneasy feeling throughout the first few episodes because the show never quite spells out if anyone involved here is a ""bad"" guy or a ""good"" guy. Rather, everyone lives in this murky in-between, and that makes for compelling character drama.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4636,The Old Man,1,"The Old Man, based on Thomas Perry's 2017 novel, displays bursts of crackerjack energy as the season continues. Too often, though, the series brings its spy-thriller momentum to a jolting halt with incongruous monologues and hackneyed writing.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4637,The Old Man,1,More compelling as an actors' showcase than as a thriller.,VUDU,94%,86%,34
4638,The Old Man,1,"The series is patient enough to let us understand its central character’s trauma, but it doesn’t make us to wallow in it.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4639,The Old Man,0,"The Old Man hits all the beats of a standard spy thriller and delivers some bone-crunching action, but the personal stuff falls flat. It strikes a meditative tone, without giving us much to meditate on.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4640,The Old Man,1,"More than just a showcase for Bridges, The Old Man is an unsparing, action-packed series about what happens when we live long enough to see the sins of the past thrown back in our faces.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4641,The Old Man,1,"What makes The Old Man worth watching is not necessarily its flashback-heavy narrative, it’s the talent at its center. Bridges and Lithgow give powerful performances as two aging men whose relationship spans decades and defies explanation.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4642,The Old Man,1,"If the simple pleasures of a dude and his dogs roaming America, picking off bad guys, sounds like your desired entertainment, The Old Man will provide it. Anything more, well, that’s yet to be seen.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4643,The Old Man,1,"Just as the 72-year-old Bridges is not a conventional action hero, The Old Man seeks out interesting narrative ground that avoids any common constraints whenever possible.",VUDU,94%,86%,34
4644,Dark Winds,1,"The series is unfortunately timely, as well, airing on the streaming network after the Supreme Court continues to take away the sovereignty of Native lands. Mostly, however, it is a terrific, well-deserved showcase for longtime character actor McClarnon.",VUDU,100%,87%,28
4645,Dark Winds,1,"McClarnon delivers an intense, if not smoldering performance, that is wonderfully complemented by actors Kiowa Gordon and Jessica Matten. A beautifully done series. ‘Dark Winds’ is the best show on AMC since ‘The Walking Dead’”",VUDU,100%,87%,28
4646,Dark Winds,1,"“Dark Winds” may seem similar to other detective shows but it’s more than that. With well-written and sharply defined characters, plus an invigorating and tightly wound story, it’ll be hard to wait a week for each episode to drop.",VUDU,100%,87%,28
4647,Dark Winds,1,Becomes easily absorbing and is already gripping. ... It's a must-watch.,VUDU,100%,87%,28
4648,Dark Winds,1,"Featuring Native-American talent in front of and behind the camera, it's a solid mystery that's better during its wide-open-spaces buildup than the somewhat messy finish.",VUDU,100%,87%,28
4649,Dark Winds,1,"As both a period piece and a cultural primer for an unabashedly Native American story told through a Native American lens, Dark Winds successfully gives audiences a different perspective and backdrop for a crime drama.",VUDU,100%,87%,28
4650,Dark Winds,1,"Dark Winds feels like it will deftly combine a standard murder mystery, tribal traditions and difficulties, and supernatural elements, tied together by a great performance by McClarnon.",VUDU,100%,87%,28
4651,Dark Winds,1,'Dark Winds' is a basic comfortable summer crime mystery you can watch with your grandparents that could easily be on network television.,VUDU,100%,87%,28
4652,Dark Winds,1,"Gripping, gorgeously shot and propelled by superb performances, Dark Winds is a very good show that also happens to be very important.",VUDU,100%,87%,28
4653,Dark Winds,1,Dark Winds is set in a time and place utterly foreign to American TV. You'll love it there.,VUDU,100%,87%,28
4654,Dark Winds,1,"Not always a gripping mystery, but a promising prelude for an ongoing series.",VUDU,100%,87%,28
4655,Dark Winds,1,“Dark Winds” has a sensibility that draws you in and compensates for the lapses in storytelling.,VUDU,100%,87%,28
4656,Dark Winds,1,"Because there is such an effort to bring authenticity to the production, the cultures and traditions of the Navajo play a central part not just in the milieu of the series but in the story itself.",VUDU,100%,87%,28
4657,Dark Winds,1,This is an atmospheric crime thriller with real potential.,VUDU,100%,87%,28
4658,Dark Winds,1,"With its welcome exploration of characters and cultures that are still under-represented, a brisk pace, and engrossing story, Dark Winds is that rare thing in contemporary TV -- a show I actually wanted to see more of.",VUDU,100%,87%,28
4659,Dark Winds,1,"McClarnon gives a powerfully measured performance, as if Leaphorn’s grief and anger can only be vented one teaspoon at a time.",VUDU,100%,87%,28
4660,Dark Winds,1,McClarnon is perfect in the role of a man forced to navigate the difficulties of simultaneously protecting his people while policing them. He moves deliberately throughout the beautifully shot series.,VUDU,100%,87%,28
4661,Dark Winds,1,"Dark Wind has an admirable directness of approach: It doesn’t slow down to explain itself to viewers, trusting that its milieu will come through loud and clear.",VUDU,100%,87%,28
4662,Dark Winds,1,"A gripping, pulpy drama with a tangible sense throughout that the people telling this story know what is distinct about it, elevating the more familiar thriller components into something that feels special.",VUDU,100%,87%,28
4663,Dark Winds,1,A heartfelt and accomplished thriller that doubles as a proof of concept for Camel Rock Studios’ ability to tell Native stories in popular television genres.,VUDU,100%,87%,28
4664,Dark Winds,1,"But, as with good mystery novels, it's the characters that make the series worthwhile. Gordon and McClarnon play nicely off each other as their sometimes contentious partnership deepens into friendship.",VUDU,100%,87%,28
4665,Dark Winds,1,"[Zach McClarnon] takes on the role of Leaphorn, and plays him so well -- with quiet dignity, a reluctant humor, and just enough menace to let you see what lies beneath the surface -- that you quickly get the feeling nobody else would have worked.",VUDU,100%,87%,28
4666,Dark Winds,1,"Dark Winds is never edge-of-your-seat stuff, the series instead cooking at a satisfying simmer.",VUDU,100%,87%,28
4667,Dark Winds,1,"Both a Western and a noir thriller that is at its most interesting when it delves into these deeper contradictions, it often loses focus on a fraught journey towards something more reflective.",VUDU,100%,87%,28

4815,The Last Kingdom,1,The culmination of this epic journey will provide long-time fans more than enough to be satisfied with. Uhtred is a top-tier character.,VUDU,91%,94%,3
4816,Fleabag,1,"Season 2 is above the sex and the drama, it's above season 1 for that matter. This time it's about the comedy, the performances, the satire and one of the most intelligent uses of the fourth wall we've seen in recent years. Full review in Spanish",VUDU,100%,93%,98

4818,Fleabag,1,Few writers could pull off turning such a deeply upsetting turn of events into a ridiculous dark comedy; the return of Fleabag marks Phoebe Waller-Bridge out as one of the most talented faces in British comedy.,VUDU,100%,93%,98
4819,Fleabag,1,"It's a perfect culmination to the character's journey, and a powerful comment on the way likability is currently framed as both the most essential and the least attainable trait a woman can have.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4820,Fleabag,1,"That's the hat trick of Fleabag - it makes the audience champion a character they might not agree with, stand with, or completely understand.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4821,Fleabag,1,"[Fleabag] deems the eternal debate about ""good feminism"" vs ""bad feminism"" as just another self-defeating litmus test against which women gauge their imperfections - which inevitably instills fears of falling short of the ""ideal feminist's"" expectations.",VUDU,100%,93%,98

4844,Fleabag,1,"Fleabag is an urgently hilarious series drawing pathos from the minute details of sisterly dynamics, fiercely feminist driven dialogue that's painful and self-reflectively honest, and sight gags such a cafe filled to the brim with guinea pig decor.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4845,Fleabag,1,"It's another to see it demonstrated artfully, holistically, and undeniably on-screen. By the end of the series, Waller-Bridge may as well be reaching through the camera to shake those of us who trust pain more than love back to life.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4846,Fleabag,1,"If the first season was about honestly coming to terms with the damage sex can do, season two is about accepting what comes after confession, about the hard work of loving, even knowing the damage that love has brought and will bring again.",VUDU,100%,93%,98

4871,Fleabag,1,"We all know someone like Fleabag. And we're all capable of empathy. The very existence of this show depends on it. Creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge has absolute faith in us. Had she not, Fleabag wouldn't have worked.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4872,Fleabag,1,"Too many modern TV shows are obsessed with depicting how we can fall apart... Give me a hundred TV shows like Fleabag: deeply fascinated with how we put ourselves back together, a much more impressive feat.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4873,Fleabag,1,"Exquisitely crafted in every line and shot, it's unflinchingly mordant in its heightened depiction of everyday awfulness, but it retains at its core a vulnerable, longing sweetness you mightn't think capable of coexisting.",VUDU,100%,93%,98

4877,Fleabag,1,"A portrait of grief, fear, and love that's startling, painful, achingly funny, unbearably sexy, pretty much perfect, and somehow better than the first season. It is a marvel. It should not exist.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4878,Fleabag,1,"Season two is somehow better than the first, and Waller-Bridge's ability to blend comedy and tragedy -- often in the same scene -- makes this show unlike anything else on television right now.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4879,Fleabag,1,"I's a spellbinding performance. But Waller-Bridge also writes generously for her gifted cast. Even Claire's skeevy, selfish husband, Martin (Brett Gelman, who has a Ph.D. in skeeve) has a moment of late clarity.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4880,Fleabag,1,"Scott is immensely likable, and it's not hard to see how Fleabag would fall for him (as ridiculous as that may sound), but where the series ultimately takes this connection seems sketchily thought out rather than fully realized.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4881,Fleabag,1,"Laughs, whimsy, English eccentricity and far too much fun. I was gasping.",VUDU,100%,93%,98

4890,Fleabag,1,A work of genius.,VUDU,100%,93%,98
4891,Fleabag,1,"Fleabag has frequently been outrageously, filthily, laugh-out-loud hilarious. But the for the most part the tone of the finale was melancholy and bittersweet...It was a sublime sign-off.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4892,Fleabag,1,"In Fleabag there are no 'strong female characters.' Instead Waller-Bridge creates a space in which women get to be as pathetic, crude, gross and hostile as they want.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4893,Fleabag,1,"Fleabag...once more showed its class, with a terrific cameo from Kristin Scott Thomas...and a final scene in which Andrew Scott's sublimely engaging priest explained to Fleabag why he wouldn't have sex with her.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4894,Fleabag,1,"So The Thorn Birds got there first, but the devilishly good Waller-Bridge is sure to have the best jokes.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4895,Fleabag,1,"As before, though, the most pitch-perfect relationship is the love-hate one with the spiky, perfectionist sister Claire.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4896,Fleabag,1,You could tell it was going to be brilliant from the first three seconds.,VUDU,100%,93%,98
4897,Fleabag,1,It is warped yet affecting. It is filthy yet elegant. It is funny yet painful.,VUDU,100%,93%,98
4898,Fleabag,1,"While I felt the first series flagged slightly towards the end, this was a dark, stylish return - the telly staple of a tense family celebration, but with sudden twists and writing so sharp it could scratch your eyes out.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4899,Fleabag,1,"It takes courage to throw mentions of paedophilia, alcoholism and miscarriage into a comedy mix, but Waller-Bridge is adept at pushing the button just hard enough, stopping short of gratuitous shock tactics.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4900,Fleabag,1,"The vivid portraits of human frailty, weakness and - in Martin's case - near-evil... drawn with just a handful of lines each from an unflinching, excoriating, lethally funny writer whose performers knock every one out of the park.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4901,Fleabag,1,"Fleabag's back, and it's better than ever.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4902,Fleabag,1,"It is a show full of nihilism that runs on optimism. You believe, because the writer wants this too, that her creations will be happy again.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4903,Fleabag,1,Waller-Bridge constructs the show so tightly that there is not a single extraneous scene.,VUDU,100%,93%,98

4909,Fleabag,1,"There were enough jokes about pedophiles, miscarriages, alcoholics, lewd sex acts and Catholic priests in Fleabag's second series opener to keep the Points Of View postbag bulging for a year.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4910,Fleabag,1,"Waller-Bridge hasn't rested on her laurels and, like all the best writers, is offering something familiar yet intriguingly different.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4911,Fleabag,1,[A] second series of Fleabag that opened with an episode so gobsmackingly good that I wanted to give [Phoebe Waller-Bridge] a standing ovation in my living room when I watched it for the second time.,VUDU,100%,93%,98
4912,Fleabag,1,"Happily, Waller-Bridge has toned down on the to-camera gestures, nods, winks and soliloquies that often bordered on the irritating, letting the terror unfold without the same level of fourth-wall breaking interventions.",VUDU,100%,93%,98
4913,Fleabag,1,"If addiction is jeopardy, Waller-Bridge has created a show that mirrors that. She's a skilled actress, but the writing is as cruel as glass.",VUDU,100%,93%,98

4923,Rise,1,"Like that of the New Directions on Glee, Stanton High School's drama department is made up of much diversity and various backgrounds. But watching their differences come together onscreen for one cause is truly magical.",VUDU,59%,76%,41
4924,Rise,1,"The story and its adult protagonist in particular are still finding their footing, but strong performances from its soon-to-be-stars make Rise worth the ride. When the younger members of the cast are allowed to take center stage, the show sings, too.",VUDU,59%,76%,41
4925,Rise,1,"Rise is up there as one of the best new shows, and that's down to the first class acting, relatable characters and an exciting subject matter. If you thought about overlooking this show, you should give it a shot. You will not be disappointed.",VUDU,59%,76%,41
4926,Rise,0,"The audience doesn't get the chance to discover the students' strengths along with the characters...The way Rise unfolds now, there's no tension and no release. Events just happen one after the other.",VUDU,59%,76%,41
4927,Rise,0,"When Rise shifts focus to one of Robbie's big games, it becomes painfully apparent how effortlessly Friday Night Lights stirred the emotions Rise struggles to find. It's not until the season finale that the show realizes its full tear-jerking potential.",VUDU,59%,76%,41

4932,Rise,1,"When Rise finds its stride and lets its kids hit their high notes, it can be breathtaking. But the show has one huge anchor of a problem that keeps it from truly taking off. Rise's supposedly inspirational teacher is a patronizing nightmare.",VUDU,59%,76%,41
4933,Rise,1,"I still feel like I bought tickets to a Broadway show I really, really wanted to see and I didn't get my money's worth. That being said, I couldn't stop watching. So there's definitely something here. I'm just waiting for [it] to rise to its potential.",VUDU,59%,76%,41

4937,Rise,0,"Rise wants to be an inspiring drama. More accurate to describe it as a drama about wanting to be inspirational...Rise seems uninterested in its own best instincts, willing to bring up ideas but unwilling to carry them over the finish line.",VUDU,59%,76%,41
4938,Rise,1,"What concerns me, after watching the first half of this first season of Rise, is that so many characters are stock, and virtually every plot point is easily and disappointingly telegraphed and predictable.",VUDU,59%,76%,41
4939,Rise,1,"Despite its flaws, Rise does a commendable job of evoking that feeling and many of the other complications that accompany the transition from adolescence to adulthood.",VUDU,59%,76%,41
4940,Rise,1,"It is predictable, sometimes down to individual lines; the title itself gives the arc away. But predictability is part of what makes musical theater tick; it delivers the thrill the crowd comes for, dramatic tension leading to inspirational release.",VUDU,59%,76%,41

4948,Rise,1,"In a sense, the show itself is a rumination on whether a song would be enough to bridge any number of American divides. Part of the appeal of Rise is that it sure would be nice to think so.",VUDU,59%,76%,41
4949,Rise,1,What Rise has going for it is an honesty that prevents it from falling into the traps in which Glee frequently became stuck.,VUDU,59%,76%,41

4960,The Mist,1,"Spike's new series based on ""The Mist"" (which was made into a Frank Darabont film in 2007, with a controversial altered ending) wasn't written by King, but it does the author proud.",VUDU,60%,47%,46

5090,Shameless,1,"I love this show, messy flaws, brazen outrageousness, frenetic pacing, offensive story lines, hyper-farcical turns and all. It's not a Breaking Bad or a Mad Men, a pair of near-perfect specimens, but it has the kind of humanity that inspires my devotion.",VUDU,82%,81%,10
5091,Shameless,1,Its crudeness and empathy give it a realism that makes the humor both genuinely funny but also challenging.,VUDU,82%,81%,10
5092,Shameless,0,"After months of delays, Shameless is back and more uneven than ever... Narratively speaking, there was no direction. A show in its final season should have set up conflicts that need to be resolved by the time the series finale arrives.",VUDU,82%,81%,10
5093,Shameless,1,"Is social distancing happening? No freaking way, but I don't think Shameless would work if all of the characters hung out at home. Nor would it seem believable that they could afford to do so.",VUDU,82%,81%,10
5094,Shameless,0,"I understand that Shameless continues to find Frank useful, but the results are never actually interesting, nor do they ever add up to anything.",VUDU,82%,81%,10
5095,Shameless,1,"These struggles are perfect for the show to cover because the Gallaghers have always managed to find a way with or without money and during the current climate, that struggle is even more extreme.",VUDU,82%,81%,10
5096,The Office,1,"As the show moves into its final seasons, the parody eases up and even Jim comes to realize that the office where he spends the majority of his waking hours is where the most significant relationships of his life will be formed.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5097,The Office,1,"There will never be anything else to come along with the exact right balance of deadpan comedy, corporate cynicism and full-blooded heart to fill the hole that The Office left behind.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5098,The Office,0,"The Office has seemed lost, particularly by devoting substantial time to world-building Dwight's beet farm, a remnant of a failed spin-off effort.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5099,The Office,1,"It was just right. For as much as we complained about the latter half of the series and yearned for the Michael Scott years, the ending was more about the fact that you took a journey with these characters.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5100,The Office,1,"You get to the point where you can't stand the sight of the thing that you used to love, and there's a huge relief when you finally decide to end it. But it's then... that the things that you used to love so much decide to reappear.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5101,The Office,0,"It succumbed to the bane of American TV -- the endless more-more-more of anything good or popular, the twisting of characters into pretzels to simply keep them in motion, the cheap substitutes after lead actors depart.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5102,The Office,1,"For nine years now, The Office has provided us with more laughs than we can count, and anyone who doesn't have it on their list of the Top 10 TV comedies of all time needs to redo their list.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5103,The Office,1,"The Office may have lost almost all of its subtly in season eight, but it regained just enough of it to send it off right in season nine.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5104,The Office,0,"There's some symmetry in the fact that after eight years, four Emmys, three regional managers, and an untold number of parties in the conference room, The Office's farewell feels more like an afterthought than an event.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5105,The Office,0,I concluded that I was watching a show that wasn't just winding down. It was being taken off life support.,VUDU,81%,89%,58
5106,The Office,1,"I thought it was a fitting finale to the show overall, and if there weren't a lot of [laugh out loud]-worthy jokes, the more emotional elements made up for it.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5107,The Office,1,"Even though its later seasons never lived up to its groundbreaking early explorations of contemporary work culture, what The Office leaves us with are memories of television comedy at its best.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5108,The Office,0,"And so NBC's The Office takes its leave, after overstaying its welcome and most often erring on the side of over-worked sentiment rather than pure comedy.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5109,The Office,1,"When the focus shifts from primary characters to the entire cast, we're reminded that a strong, comedic ensemble still exists.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5110,The Office,1,"It was always the damaged characters who made the show worth watching, and it was the ingenious performances of Mr. Carell as the aggressively clueless boss and Mr. Wilson as his raging acolyte that made it distinctive.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5111,The Office,1,"It is not quite the same show as the one that debuted in March 2005, but it has continued to be a show I watch, grumbling occasionally, with great and in many respects increasing pleasure.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5112,The Office,1,"This was no ordinary television series, and no ordinary season.",VUDU,81%,89%,58

5115,The Office,1,...acceptable but not exceptional.,VUDU,81%,89%,58
5116,The Office,1,"I laughed, I cried, I kvelled, I nodded along, I ignored doubts, I admired zingers, I marvelled at the restrained use of flashbacks.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5117,The Office,1,"There's a confident snap to the proceedings here that's been missed, and I appreciate his willingness to go dark.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5118,The Office,1,"So this is it, the end. The Office is finally over, and while it still stings, I'm left satisfied and happy with no lingering questions or doubts",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5119,The Office,1,"All in all, it was a satisfying end to a series that had been unsatisfying for a good long while.",VUDU,81%,89%,58

5121,The Office,1,"In the end, it worked.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5122,The Office,1,"At its best The Office was far from ordinary and, even if its most-rewarding days were in the rear-view mirror, deserved to finish on top.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5123,The Office,1,Good comedies make you laugh. Great ones also make you cry. The Office proved why it belongs in the latter camp with a series finale full of the poignancy you'd expect from a comedy that was never afraid to show its heart.,VUDU,81%,89%,58
5124,The Office,1,"It's the sort of American Dream job - and job security - many people stopped believing in eons ago. That's why we loved The Office and hated the office. It was meant to look real, but it was pure escapism all along.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5125,The Office,1,Few things on TV are as heartening as signs of life in a show that seemed creatively dead. The Office is this year's surprise resurrectee.,VUDU,81%,89%,58
5126,The Office,1,"The long arc of this, its final season, has been the slow but sure destabilization of its sweetest and surest thing, the loving relationship between Jim and Pam Halpert.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5127,The Office,0,"Sorry, Dunder Mifflin, I might come back for your going-out-of-business sale (or whatever constitutes a not-so-grand finale), but for now, you're in fourth position in this time period once everything kicks into gear next week.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5128,The Office,1,"The Office opened back up for business Thursday, and it looks like business is, once again, good.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5129,The Office,1,"The writers of The Office know this is their chance to hit the reset button and deliver one last quality season before riding off into the sunset, and ""New Guys"" made it clear that that's exactly what they aim to do.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5130,The Office,1,The Office will go down as one of the best comedies ever to grace our television screens.,VUDU,81%,89%,58

5133,The Office,0,Will those of us who've gradually fallen away return to see it out? I'm still not sure I will after seeing Thursday's Season 9 premiere,VUDU,81%,89%,58
5134,The Office,0,"The Season 9 premiere, ""New Guys,"" is as uneven as most episodes have been for the last few years.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5135,The Office,1,"Despite some nagging flaws and off-notes, ""New Guys"" delivered an enjoyable and confident season opener that helped define the path for the episodes to come.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5136,The Office,1,"With the end of the series in sight, it now has a renewed sense of purpose - to go out strongly, and perhaps paying off on a number of long-running subplots.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5137,The Office,1,"The arrival of the new guys forces Jim to realize he's trapped in the job he despised back when he was that young. I've been waiting for this character arc for years now, and the scenes were promising (if not incredibly funny).",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5138,The Office,1,The results so far are very (very) funny.,VUDU,81%,89%,58
5139,The Office,1,"It's worth taking a trip to the darker, more depressing, awkward, uncomfortable, and just plain sad version of The Office that started it all: the original.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5140,The Office,1,"The humor's slightly darker than the American version, with more focus on characters' dissatisfaction with their dead-end job at a paper company, and Ricky Gervais steals every scene he's in as David Brent, the bumbling boss.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5141,The Office,1,"The genius of the show is Gervais, who also writes and directs, putting the vile Brent into situations that are ripe for disaster - and promptly turn out much worse than anyone could have imagined.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5142,The Office,1,It is all unspeakably beautiful.,VUDU,81%,89%,58
5143,The Office,1,The Office is a remarkable piece of TV history - a genuine institution of comedy and creativity that has inspired more television series than most.,VUDU,81%,89%,58
5144,The Office,1,What is so endearing and hilarious about the show is the utter honesty captured by the camera.,VUDU,81%,89%,58
5145,The Office,1,"Fortunately the BBC series (2001-'03), totaling about eight hours, has been collected on DVD, and this marathon screening offers neophytes a chance to immerse themselves in its black humor and disarming pathos.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5146,The Office,1,"Although you'll never forget that The Office is fake, one aspect of the show feels very real: It captures the blend of frustration and tedium that makes up the bulk of most people's lives.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5147,The Office,1,"Written and directed by star Gervais and Stephen Merchant, ""The Office"" stings with its depiction of office politics and personalities at their most petulant.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5148,The Office,1,"But if we are to take The Office as a perfect artistic expression of the passions, desires and fears of our age, like a Michelangelo painting but on telly and starring a fat bloke, what makes it what it is?",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5149,The Office,1,"Throughout all 14 episodes of the British series, we never once believe that what we are seeing couldn't ever happen in an actual office.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5150,The Office,1,"t's a hilarious, funny, terrific show, but it's also a deeply sad one, a comic tragedy that puts the emphasis on the latter word in the final two episodes of its second series.",VUDU,81%,89%,58
5151,The Office,1,The Office is most appealing when it's most appalling.,VUDU,81%,89%,58
5152,The Office,1,The Office still feels unique in its commitment to the bleak monotony of the average British working day.,VUDU,81%,89%,58
5153,The Office,1,But perhaps what was most surprising was that a comedy set in the average workplace appealed so much to us - people too young to have spent much time in one. It proved good comedy is universal and eternal.,VUDU,81%,89%,58

5156,Supernatural,1,The ultimate series comes to a close with an epic final season.,VUDU,93%,75%,12
5157,Supernatural,1,"If there is some small silver lining to be found in this soft and ambiguous landing, it allows the perfect opportunity for the fandom to do what it's always done: create a version of the story they prefer.",VUDU,93%,75%,12
5158,Supernatural,1,"Sam and Dean have matured and evolved along with the people watching them, and their separate journeys speak to the darkness hunkered down within each of us and our wider culture.",VUDU,93%,75%,12
5159,Supernatural,1,"The Supernatural series finale took its time, gracefully balancing reference and nostalgia with a hunt and endgame worthy of its legacy.",VUDU,93%,75%,12
5160,Supernatural,1,"In classic Supernatural form, it was funny, filled with love, and downright devastating.",VUDU,93%,75%,12
5161,Supernatural,1,"Supernatural's season fifteen premiere is an enjoyable, action-packed affair which doesn't exactly make it clear where things are going from here but still points to it being a fun, final ride for the Winchesters.",VUDU,93%,75%,12
5162,Supernatural,1,"This premiere episode feels like a mix of the old Supernatural and the new. These urban legends fit the aesthetic of the early seasons a lot better, but they're not entirely out of place.",VUDU,93%,75%,12
5163,Supernatural,1,"It's a great start to the final season. There are lots of questions and lots of work to do, but Sam and Dean can handle it -- like they always do.",VUDU,93%,75%,12
5164,Supernatural,1,"Supernatural starts out the final season in the best way it possibly can. Dean and Castiel one liners, an appreciation for its history, and new stakes to carry them through the final season.",VUDU,93%,75%,12
5165,Supernatural,1,I was already excited for this season and the big fight facing the Winchesters. It's not fair to throw amazing fan service and heart-warming quotes at me. My feelings just don't stand a chance this season.,VUDU,93%,75%,12
5166,Vikings,1,These episodes land with the fury of Thor's hammer.,VUDU,93%,87%,12
5167,Vikings,1,"The thrills take their time, but when they come, they come with a mighty rush.",VUDU,93%,87%,12
5168,Vikings,1,"Season 6 had an entire fanbase on its shoulders, and it delivers the final episodes with care, thought and precision.",VUDU,93%,87%,12
5169,Vikings,1,"Vikings has been nominated for a string of Emmy awards, in categories ranging from editing to special visual effects, but has yet to receive any. An absolute travesty.",VUDU,93%,87%,12
5170,Vikings,1,Alexander does an incredible job of portraying Bjorn's torment over his choices and his struggle in trying to make the right decision.,VUDU,93%,87%,12
5171,Vikings,1,"All told, a strong return for Vikings, blessedly absent of all the preposterous nonsense that made last season so unbearable. On the other hand, it was largely setup for a conflict that I think has already worn out its welcome.",VUDU,93%,87%,12
5172,Vikings,1,Vikings' first two Season 6 episodes introduced some wicked new wild cards while teasing future conflicts.,VUDU,93%,87%,12
5173,Vikings,1,"It remains to be seen whether Vikings can sustain a level of interest fans of the show have come to expect, but hopefully, this final season won't follow Lagertha's lead and disappear into obscurity.",VUDU,93%,87%,12
5174,Vikings,1,"We can never be certain about how well a series will nail the ending, but at least with ""Vikings,"" the fandom's faith can lean on a firmer foundation based in history and demonstrated skill as opposed to spectacle and whim",VUDU,93%,87%,12
5175,Vikings,1,"What seems evident after the first two episodes of Vikings Season 6 is that the series is starting to wrap up organically, unlike that show with dragons that fizzled out in its final season.",VUDU,93%,87%,12
5176,Vikings,1,"Vikings' subplot game has been hit or miss throughout its run... Still, the prospect of Ubbe on a Floki quest, while Bjorn faces his first real adversity as king could have the makings of character-defining arcs.",VUDU,93%,87%,12
5177,Vikings,1,"Which, again, fun. But for a show struggling to recapture the sense of sweep and character it initially promised, Ivar's new pal is leading him, and us, down a well-trod path to the same bloodied ground.",VUDU,93%,87%,12
5178,Suits,0,It was about as middle of the road and predictable as to be expected from Suits.,VUDU,90%,87%,5
5179,Suits,1,"The writing remains quick and direct, which is essential in a show so dependent on lawyer talk.",VUDU,90%,87%,5
5180,Suits,1,"It's a smart way to end, bringing it all full circle and tugging on our heartstrings along the way, reminding us that this story was always about their friendship and their mentorship.",VUDU,90%,87%,5
5181,Suits,1,"Suits is running on fumes and should have really called it quits with Season 8. If anything, this final season already feels like it's around purely to get people to tune in to the Gina Torres-fronted spinoff, Pearson.",VUDU,90%,87%,5
5182,Suits,1,It's royally entertaining.,VUDU,90%,87%,5

5186,You,1,"[Joe is] an often despicable character, an unrepentant self-serving creep, and yet sharp writing and a great performance from Badgley make him one of the more entertaining characters on television.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5187,You,1,"It delivers. If you're in for thrills, chills and kills, you're getting that this season.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5188,You,1,"I would love to have [Joe] narrate my own life, if I didn't know what that level of attention from him would mean for me.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5189,You,0,"The stakes with ""You"" always lie in Joe being a protagonist you root against. But by season three's end, we stopped enjoying the ride - all we want is for Joe to receive his comeuppance.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5190,You,1,"You is one of those series that one would expect would have lost its momentum by the third season. However, instead of hitting its plateau this show only keeps getting better.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5191,You,1,"I love the sardonic tone and bluntness of the storytelling. Love's recklessness does become a point of contention, though.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5192,You,1,"Joe and Love, seemingly perfect for each other before, have become something so disgusting and revulsive that you can't look away from the disaster.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5193,You,1,"The stakes are higher and so is the tension. Joe may be a family man now, but he's still the guy who builds cages. And the rest of the excitement of this season is watching to find out if he ends up in one.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5194,You,1,Season 3 Is the best installment yet-and a brilliant send-up of suburbia...,VUDU,91%,76%,56
5195,You,1,"In Season 3, You has room to unpack the full potential of that twist. The show is no longer about a single predator who fixates on women; it's about a couple of predators who have to balance their own impulses...",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5196,You,1,"You remains a twisted guilty pleasure that will entertain its most fervent fans, but my own obsession with it is waning unless it shows me something more.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5197,You,1,"The show's latest round of episodes may comprise its best outing yet. After a second season that lulled in the middle, You's third outing doesn't let up.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5198,You,1,"You is a sly guilty pleasure as such things go. Joe's prolific and wry inner dialogue narrates and critiques the action, ensuring that we see him as weird, funny, appealing, carnal, sexy and menacing.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5199,You,1,This was a really solid season... [Victoria Pedretti and Penn Badgley] playing opposite each other is really strong.,VUDU,91%,76%,56
5200,You,1,"Still a totally twisted delight, You somehow manages to take the stakes and performances to a whole new level in Season 3.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5201,You,1,"What began as one-note thriller about a dangerous stalker became a savage spoof of internet-era relationships and, this season, a savage mockery of marriage and domestic bliss. It's crazy but so, so smart. Love it.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5202,You,1,"YOU Season 3 elevates the series out of its pulpy beginnings and into more grounded drama. ... Fans of the show will enjoy the same potent blend of sensual heat and spine-tingling chills, but with a new and more anchored approach",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5203,You,1,"As it does the impossible and wiggles out of its initial premise, You is becoming more self-aware - and it's all the better for it.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5204,You,1,"Regardless of the conclusions it draws, ""You"" remains a fascinating look at just how hard it is to outwit and outrun your own nature.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5205,You,1,The best thing about this season that makes it really work is that they actually expand the perspective outside of Joe's head.,VUDU,91%,76%,56
5206,You,1,"Honestly, I could watch these two attempt to out-gaslight, gatekeep, and girlboss each other to a pulpy soundtrack of Baby Queen and Taylor Swift for another 10 episodes.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5207,You,1,"YOU Season 3 is the strongest season yet, and somehow, the premise is not derivative of itself.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5208,You,1,"changing locations and adding Victoria Pedretti as co-star refreshed the series into a sexy, dynamic, fun season, full of twists and bloody surprises. [Full review in Spanish]",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5209,You,1,It stays true to the expectations it has set in the previous seasons and moves at a delightfully breathless pace.,VUDU,91%,76%,56
5210,You,1,"If there is something You does correctly, it's the exploration of loss. To examine what it feels like as a person who previously experienced abuse, to witness abuse, again from a place without power.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5211,You,1,You's third season is like watching a collision from the sidelines; you're unable to look away because you want to see who walks away.,VUDU,91%,76%,56
5212,You,1,"It promises the same two-faced neighborhood drama, hilarious delusions, literary references, and misplaced self-righteousness that got us hooked before but leaves plenty of room for uncertainty on how the plot unfurls.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5213,You,1,"The season, ultimately, is a raging success, yet my goodness, there's a lot here.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5214,You,0,"More and more, the show seems to be saying, Joe's struggles are just a slightly amped-up version of the viewer's own. He's ""You."" But there's too much grotesque violence in the show's past for us to relate to him, or to take the show on its own terms.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5215,You,1,"You is gonna You, and it Yous spectacularly. Come for the glass box, stay to find out who goes in it, and watch it all go down in flames because you don't dare to look away.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5216,You,1,"The season belongs to Badgley and Pedretti, who share formidable (and foreboding) chemistry.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5217,You,1,"Season 3 does a fine job at showcasing the vapidness of a Silicon Valley-like suburb, where neighbors are mostly concerned with intermittent fasting, drugs and updating their Instagram stories on the hour every hour.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5218,You,1,"A stalker drama can be fun, but it's got nothing on the murder-romp possibilities of a serial killer Mr. and Mrs. Smith, where no one trusts anyone else but also someone needs to finish up the murdering in time to take over child-care duties.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5219,You,1,"Though it can be overstuffed at times, You balances brazen humor with emotional intelligence, all while keeping the mystery intact.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5220,You,1,"Pedretti's performance is a delicious mix of rage and bougie suburban white lady privilege, a chaotic tour de force that's every bit as messy and reactionary as Badgley's Joe is removed and calculating.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5221,You,1,"While it is always good fun to see Badgely deliver Joe's narcissism and delusional but witty outlook on romance, it has to be said that Pedretti really is the most valuable and interesting figure in the third run.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5222,You,1,"You would be better served by not stopping to make excuses for Joe's behavior at this juncture, because it's actually at its best when it doesn't apologize for being a juicy, twisted thriller.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5223,You,1,The change is scenery has stopped You from feeling stale. The pacing is quick and the twists rarely expected. The third season of this Netflix show continues to be a bingeable delight,VUDU,91%,76%,56
5224,You,1,"Stick with it, and you will be rewarded beyond your wildest, blood-soaked dreams.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5225,You,1,"The result is schlocky, subversive fun, a series that, while certainly not for everyone, even if you're not already a fan, could become your new obsession, at least until the return of the real Dexter next month.",VUDU,91%,76%,56
5226,You,1,"This season Love actually out-crazies Joe, but grounds herself in their mutual common ground: self-pity. #diandrareviews",VUDU,91%,76%,56

5305,Counterpart,1,"An exacting performance by Simmons, again, goes a long way toward illustrating just how crucial clarity can be in the growing, changing realm of science fiction.",VUDU,100%,90%,22
5306,Counterpart,1,"I wish I could watch a Prime-world version of Counterpart. But we do not have two worlds, so instead I will keep watching the version of Counterpart we do have, and enjoy it for the good things it offers, like Simmons's performance.",VUDU,100%,90%,22

5369,Fargo,1,"Buckley's daft performance is the star turn of a very talented cast. Evaluating the rest of the show, however, is more difficult, particularly its attempt to establish a moral footing for itself.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5370,Fargo,1,"Back for its fourth season, the important good news is this iteration of Fargo is significantly better than the disappointing third season, though probably not as good as the near-perfect second season.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5371,Fargo,1,"It may not be the show's most exciting season, but in the longer term, it may be the most important.",VUDU,93%,84%,56

5373,Fargo,1,"Incredibly ambitious, at times outrageously inventive and breathtaking, Noah Hawley's Coen Brothers-inspired anthology series is back with a bang.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5374,Fargo,1,"It's the most epic-scaled season of Fargo yet, and while it has sprawling-story problems, it's always riveting.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5375,Fargo,1,"Buckley has marked herself out as one of the leading lights of her generation. On the evidence so far, this is her finest performance yet.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5376,Fargo,1,"Is it bad? Not exactly. But it is kind of dull, and what's striking is how tentatively the new season seems to be willing to engage in those few elements of its setting that are unique.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5377,Fargo,0,"If all of this sounds like a lot of strands to tie together, it is-but unlike in previous seasons, many of these strands really feel ancillary to the gangland drama that stodgily occupies center stage.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5378,Fargo,1,"Season 4 is a sharp enough break to restore faith in Fargo as a concept. Whatever else it may be, this new story isn't inert. And after such a moribund Season 3, it's strong evidence the well hasn't run dry just yet.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5379,Fargo,0,"The characters tend to be as thin as the story they inhabit, though, and vivid performers like Buckley and Esposito (of the Italian gangster series ""Gomorrah"") can't do much with the cartoons they've been given to play.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5380,Fargo,1,"Like this nation, the new season is a beautiful and ugly, inspiring and infuriating, a tragic and sometimes darkly hilarious mess. As frustrating as it often was to watch, I couldn't look away.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5381,Fargo,0,"Outsize characterizations are not new for ""Fargo,"" but a balance has been lost here, with many characters standing in for the grandest sorts of evil and too few giving us what the series at its best possesses - soulfulness.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5382,Fargo,1,"Hawley has more than proved that he's a worthy foe of tropes and cliches, but here, his vision can at times feel detrimentally self-indulgent... What does work here, at times terrifically, is the complete shift in setting.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5383,Fargo,0,"When one character asks a question of another and then announces with a self-regarding smirk that it was rhetorical... Fargo disappears into its own navel, where even the lint is annotated.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5384,Fargo,1,"Fargo, as in past seasons, manages to be both more dramatic, and more comic, than almost any other show on TV right now.",VUDU,93%,84%,56

5389,Fargo,1,"Rock dives into the material and adds emotional gravitas. His charisma as a performer creates comedic elements with ease, but he never loses sight of the stakes.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5390,Fargo,1,"If you've stuck with ""Fargo"" this long and over the years haven't been turned away by the freewheeling nature of its story or the quirky characters which inhabit the narrative, than season 4 will prove just as rewarding.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5391,Fargo,0,"Fargo has always been a little off-kilter, but those elements stand out as particularly indulgent or egregious this season, when its overall storytelling approach is so uneven.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5392,Fargo,1,"You practically need a map, the series is so all over the place. But frustrations and all, it's a journey worth taking.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5393,Fargo,1,. It feels like Hawley is going less for the quirky black humor of the first three seasons and more for the tone of what was seen in the Coen's early serious films.,VUDU,93%,84%,56
5394,Fargo,1,"Clearly Hawley needed to get out of Minnesota to recharge his batteries, but maybe it's time to leave the Coen sandbox for good.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5395,Fargo,1,"The Coen Brothers make movies about quirky characters, but it would be nice if Noah Hawley and the team behind the Fargo TV series would remember that there's more to those movies than the quirk.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5396,Fargo,1,"The sprawling set of characters gives the story an appropriate epic scope, which is a new approach for the series, and makes this season feel fresh, even if it's operating in a well-established genre.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5397,Fargo,1,"Even when it isn't peak Fargo and despite being weighted down by ambitions that aren't fully realized thus far, there are sweeping swathes of greatness here.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5398,Fargo,0,"Fargo has lost its footing in Season 4, succumbing to stylization and caricature and gratuitous over-plotting, and effectively wasting a tremendous cast. We're left with a weak story and a few banal monologues about race, money, and Life In America.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5399,Fargo,1,"Like America itself, Fargo is a dizzying, delightful swirl of influences. And this move away from the series' familiar Minnesota home turf is mostly a rollicking success.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5400,Fargo,1,A season of television that struggles to feel cohesive but does deliver some stand-out moments and fantastic characters.,VUDU,93%,84%,56
5401,Fargo,1,"Fargo has always been good, from the very beginning, against odds so long you could wrap them around the earth like a lasso. None of that changes here. I can't wait to see how the rest of this rumpus hashes itself out.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5402,Fargo,1,Season 4 is feeling a bit like diminishing returns. Which is not to say the show is at all bad; it's still fun to watch and exceptionally well-made. It just doesn't feel as vital as it once did.,VUDU,93%,84%,56
5403,Fargo,1,"With a strong point of view, impeccable scenery and sharp acting (as usual), it's easy to forgive a rather slow start.",VUDU,93%,84%,56
5404,Fargo,1,"Another exemplary cast elevates wordless gestures and already witty lines into exciting entertainment, with Jessie Buckley and Glynn Turman being the overall breakouts, but this version of Fargo feels bleaker than any that preceded it.",VUDU,93%,84%,56

5407,Attack on Titan,1,"Shishido's direction did not manage to communicate so eloquently the increasingly complex narrative, although the fault lies at least as much on the original material. The one thing he does pretty well, however, is bring all the storylines together",VUDU,96%,95%,3
5408,Attack on Titan,1,"Te final season's premiere continues Attack on Titan's deft focus on the no-win hell that is war, and while fans may miss those familiar faces, the new additions to the cast and their side of the story are sure to impress.",VUDU,96%,95%,3

5413,Riverdale,1,"For now, Rivervale is a deliciously fun place to be. Deep in the horror genre, it's a new twist on old structures, filled with high stakes, age-old curses, major character deaths, and a top-notch 4th wall-breaking narrator.",VUDU,80%,51%,5

5426,Killing Eve,0,"Groundbreaking when it began, the caper starring Jodie Comer and Sandra Oh as cat and mouse, should probably have ended a couple of seasons back. What started as Tom and Jerry now resembles the complicated romance in Krazy Kat.",VUDU,89%,73%,31

5504,Taboo,1,"Hardy is sensational, and the greater mysteries proposed by the writing are compelling enough to keep us on the show's hooks.",VUDU,76%,92%,67
5505,Taboo,1,The metaphorical gloom and doom of Taboo is likewise dense and relentless but so enveloping you can't help but be sucked in.,VUDU,76%,92%,67
5506,Taboo,1,"The first dip into this brutal world is slow-going, but the tempo and story pick up as the episodes go on.",VUDU,76%,92%,67
5507,Taboo,0,The series itself dives into bewildering sojourns through memory. . .or is it fantasy?. . . showing tribespeople with painted faces and bizarre asides in which James whispers in unfamiliar tongues to unseen forces.,VUDU,76%,92%,67
5508,Taboo,1,"I was heartily sick of gloomy, gritty TV shows, but engaging ones can't help but pull me in... I think I'm officially in.",VUDU,76%,92%,67
5509,Taboo,1,It's worth the effort.,VUDU,76%,92%,67
5510,Taboo,1,"Taboo's gruff and tough and silly, and I'm hooked.",VUDU,76%,92%,67
5511,Taboo,0,"This tale sometimes feels like what might have happened if Sweeney Todd went after the East India Company, but it's weighed down by less-than-thrilling characterization.",VUDU,76%,92%,67
5512,Taboo,1,"Hardy may want to mix in a romantic comedy sometime soon, if only for his own sanity. But for now, he's got demons to work out and it's an exorcism worth watching.",VUDU,76%,92%,67
5513,Taboo,1,Some of my tolerance is thanks to Hardy and his capable co-stars. Some of it thanks to Taboo's sumptuous period detail... There's enough intriguing stuff here to keep me watching.,VUDU,76%,92%,67
5514,Taboo,1,"This is clearly an obsessive, personal work, and it's intriguing on that level - more so if you're a fan of Tom Hardy, who has become the most exciting example of the Miserablist school of acting.",VUDU,76%,92%,67
5515,Taboo,1,Hardy's great - as always - but the story at times can be as turgid as the Thames in winter.,VUDU,76%,92%,67

5519,Taboo,0,"Taboo is not so much a show as it is an ordeal, a slog through a miasma of squalid period clichés that's possibly even less inviting than last season's FX vanity production, The Bastard Executioner.",VUDU,76%,92%,67

5522,Taboo,1,"It's definitely a Tom Hardy vehicle, but it's got a hell of an ensemble supporting him.",VUDU,76%,92%,67
5523,Taboo,1,"Hardy rocks the period clothing, strutting around in an open overcoat practically down to his ankles and a commanding stovepipe hat. With anyone else, this show would not be half as engrossing.",VUDU,76%,92%,67
5524,Taboo,0,"The focus on grim portentousness and rank atmosphere keeps bogging down the story, which needed more attention to achieve the balance it seeks among gothic bodice-ripper, Heart of Darkness social tract and corporate thriller.",VUDU,76%,92%,67
5525,Taboo,1,"FX dramas are invariably gritty, but the mood here seems organic to the story, in the way it did, say, on Deadwood. Whether Taboo can rise to that level remains to be seen, but based on first impressions, Hardy's TV return is pretty hardy indeed.",VUDU,76%,92%,67
5526,Taboo,1,"Brimming with all the sex and violence you'd expect from this aptly titled historical costume drama, Steven Knight and Tom Hardy's Taboo appears poised to deliver the promised goods well beyond its suppressed introductory episodes.",VUDU,76%,92%,67

5529,Taboo,0,"It's an utter slog, and the biggest creative misstep FX has made in a while.",VUDU,76%,92%,67
5530,Taboo,1,"It's an aggressive, fearless, and periodically nasty story filled with men who Delaney wants to kill, and told in a fashion that makes waiting all the more entertaining.",VUDU,76%,92%,67
5531,Taboo,1,"It's a rich mix of intrigues with the occasional bout of brutal violence as Delaney tries to build his own empire and assumedly reclaim his one true illicit love. Hopefully, along the way, he'll discover the joy of serial bathing.",VUDU,76%,92%,67
5532,Taboo,0,"All of the show's brooding and scheming goes nowhere, and the macho posturing of the various characters wears out its welcome pretty quickly.",VUDU,76%,92%,67

5535,Taboo,1,"Despite 'Taboo's desire to show the dark and gritty aspects of Georgian London, it also has a style to it that is all its own.",VUDU,76%,92%,67
5536,Taboo,1,"It's a family drama, albeit dark and gritty, and it's a shame we only get eight episodes.",VUDU,76%,92%,67
5537,Taboo,1,"Despite coming out of the gates slower than is ideal in a crowded landscape, the series shows signs in the early going of blossoming into something much bigger and better.",VUDU,76%,92%,67

5543,Lost,1,"Satisfying in a sentimental way, the eagerly anticipated finale was neither as challenging as the series at its best, nor as convoluted as the series at its most frustrating. And it left enough questions to keep the watercooler humming for weeks.",VUDU,85%,91%,34

5547,Lost,0,The series squandered its final season in a misguided effort to transform its trademark narrative ingenuity into a grand metaphysical statement.,VUDU,85%,91%,34
5548,Lost,1,"I've always thought it was one of the smartest-written shows on TV; certainly the most ambitious. I also knew that ABC kept this show around for prestige and Emmy consideration, but this was pretty good television -- like one long movie.",VUDU,85%,91%,34
5549,Lost,1,"There are finales that betray their lead-ups, but LOST isn't one of them. Instead, it dove right into the heart of the show to get to what made LOST stand out with every other television show that tried to capture the buzzy mystery element.",VUDU,85%,91%,34
5550,Lost,1,"The finale of 'Lost' is not bad. It is not the best that they could have offered, but it is not so horrible that it automatically invalidates all the rest of the series. [Full Review in Spanish]",VUDU,85%,91%,34

5558,Lost,1,"Certainly it was more rewarding than The Sopranos and Seinfeld, both of which didn't end so much as stop, and we're grateful the writers didn't go the the route of Newhart or St. Elsewhere.",VUDU,85%,91%,34

5639,The Haunting of Hill House,1,"At once veering away any prior adaptation of Jackson's novel and paying tribute to staples of the horror genre, Hill House is an addictive slow burn of a binge that will have you biting your blanket in fear and tiptoeing in the dark.",VUDU,93%,91%,103

5642,The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Unlike Gerald's Game, Flanagan's greatest strength here is when he's playing with the story as opposed to being slavishly devoted to it. It's a reimagining for an era that doesn't know what that word means anymore.",VUDU,93%,91%,103

5647,The Haunting of Hill House,1,The best haunted-house stories aren't scary because they're filled with a long lineup of ghosties and ghoulies. They're scary because they want something from the haunted.,VUDU,93%,91%,103
5648,The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Its real potential lies in breaking the mold more than reapplying it. It's the people who haunt viewers more than the ghosts, and emphasizing the stories of the living is what makes Netflix's horror show come alive.",VUDU,93%,91%,103

5654,The Haunting of Hill House,1,"It's not just the family premise that makes this series so brilliant, but the characters as individuals themselves.

5693,Altered Carbon,1,"It's no secret Mackie is a Hollywood veteran, but this is the first time he has had eight hours of screen time to stretch his legs as one character - and he is fantastic.",VUDU,75%,64%,36
5694,Altered Carbon,0,"The ideas behind the premise are so good, the potential to examine existential issues about identity and humanity and how they're tied up in our physical form are so great, that it's frustrating to see how often the show takes a too-shallow approach.",VUDU,75%,64%,36
5695,Altered Carbon,1,"Altered Carbon also succeeds at the level of breathtaking spectacle. After a stuttering first season, a would-be blockbuster has belatedly but emphatically achieved lift-off.",VUDU,75%,64%,36
5696,Altered Carbon,1,"By the season finale, it becomes clear that this has stopped being the Kovacs show and, instead, an ensemble endeavour that manages to satisfyingly tie up a season arc while teasing storylines yet to be explored.",VUDU,75%,64%,36
5697,Altered Carbon,1,"It still falls short of its potential, but Altered Carbon has probably done enough to ensure it runs for years to come. A lump of graphite, if not quite the full diamond.",VUDU,75%,64%,36
5698,Altered Carbon,0,"I found myself desperately wishing for Altered Carbon to leave its world of endless lives, satellite back ups, and shapeless political revolutions behind, to focus... on the AIs discarded by humanity as yet another resource to be wasted and forgotten.",VUDU,75%,64%,36
5699,Altered Carbon,1,"Initially, Kovacs investigating the death of yet another meth is worrisome, but Altered Carbon manages to switch gears and deliver a much more cohesive and emotionally grounded season.",VUDU,75%,64%,36

5704,Altered Carbon,1,"Altered Carbon is in good hands with Anthony Mackie taking the role of Kovacs in season 2, and first few episodes outline a strong story that honors both the original character and the introductory adventure in all its dark and violent glory.",VUDU,75%,64%,36
5705,Altered Carbon,1,"It's not without its issues, and some of the acting and writing does get very trite in places, but by and large, 'Altered Carbon' Season 2 proves itself to be an intriguing, entertaining dive into pulpy cyberpunk silliness.",VUDU,75%,64%,36
5706,Altered Carbon,0,"This season lays hard into the sci-fi and moves away from the stronger narrative ties that would lend the story to its noir roots. While still a cool show hiring dope and diverse actors, I can't help but want more from the show.",VUDU,75%,64%,36
5707,Altered Carbon,1,The personal touches keep the characters grounded even when they're waxing poetic about the nature of life and their place in the universe.,VUDU,75%,64%,36
5708,Altered Carbon,0,"Altered Carbon has an amazing sandbox to work with, but the story doesn't always know how to play in it... The good news is that Season 2 ends on a note that could make Season 3 its best yet.",VUDU,75%,64%,36
5709,Altered Carbon,1,"While we're not quite there yet, future seasons of Altered Carbon will hopefully fix those aforementioned issues entirely, creating something that can truly ""stack"" up to the sci-fi greats that Morgan so readily draws inspiration from.",VUDU,75%,64%,36
5710,Altered Carbon,1,"This season is less horrifying, less gruesome and in some ways a little less bombastic, but it's also maybe a little more nuanced or less melodramatic.",VUDU,75%,64%,36
5711,Altered Carbon,1,"Boasts a leaner, more easily digestible cyberpunk thriller than its predecessor with surprise new sleeves, new characters and superbly crafted action.",VUDU,75%,64%,36

5713,Mad Men,1,Emotional. Brilliant. Poignant. Significant. Fun. Beautiful.,VUDU,94%,96%,61
5714,Mad Men,1,This series that launched a thousand Eames knock-offs looked a-mazing. Weiner's visual attention to period was evident to anyone who saw it and the subject of a TV industry fable...,VUDU,94%,96%,61
5715,Mad Men,1,"Mad Men smashes history, desires, dreams, and life's mundanity together like Douglas Sirk's Large Hadron Collider. It's a classic.",VUDU,94%,96%,61

5717,Mad Men,1,"Mad Men isn't back with its old saucy, sexy, 60s colour, but has ripened into something darker and more troubling.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5718,Mad Men,1,"We have a few interesting threads to follow, and a warm welcome back into the contemplative, ambiguous world of Mad Men. It'll be interesting to see if it reflects its narrative split until 2015, but for the moment, consider us fully enamored.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5719,Mad Men,1,Weiner has said that each will be like a finale. The opening one has been a terrific beginning of the end.,VUDU,94%,96%,61
5720,Mad Men,1,It's that inexorable tug and pull between the past and the future that's at the heart of Mad Men and its characters... as they reach the end (or new beginning) of the line.,VUDU,94%,96%,61
5721,Mad Men,1,Don's fears of death and the futility of his accomplishments are the natural extensions of the show's meditations on the mid-century American Dream. And yet this is territory the show has already trod over several times with Roger.,VUDU,94%,96%,61
5722,Mad Men,1,"One of Weiner's greatest achievements is to make something as banal as a firm pitching to advertise fast food (or a camera, or a cigarette, or whatever), seem worthy of the viewers' tears and devotion.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5723,Mad Men,1,Mad Men's seventh season has done some of its best work so far by leaning on its own weighty past.,VUDU,94%,96%,61
5724,Mad Men,1,"A glorious, subtle show.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5725,Mad Men,1,I find it fascinating to watch this show push around the concept of identity in regards to this ensemble.,VUDU,94%,96%,61
5726,Mad Men,1,The main event tonight is the return of Mad Men with all of the style and swagger one expects from a show that's been playing at the height of TV possibilities since the start.,VUDU,94%,96%,61
5727,Mad Men,1,"I still find the series compelling to watch, for the acting and for the writing. This end game is ramping up expectations which will be difficult to deliver on.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5728,Mad Men,1,"The hour delivers a series of lovely closing scenes that find Don feeling more honest intimacy than he has felt since the death of Anna, culminating in the kind of image and song choice that Mad Men fans find so powerful and moving.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5729,Mad Men,1,It was a fantastic entry into the season and one that already makes me long for another season we will never have.,VUDU,94%,96%,61
5730,Mad Men,1,"The show has never been about wrapping up a plot, catching a criminal, or solving a riddle. It's simply about taking a certain group of characters over a set span of time-the 1960s-and showing us who they are at the beginning and the end of it.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5731,Mad Men,1,"In any case, I ate this episode up, from the realistically tender state of Don's marriage onward. This show may be a timepiece. But it's also, for better or worse, a conversation piece.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5732,Mad Men,0,"There are peaks and valleys, but mostly there's a lot of flat, ugly middle. The victories that you spend forever building end up being as ephemeral as fireworks, sparkling briefly before quickly fading back into the endless blackness of the nighttime sky.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5733,Mad Men,1,"""Time Zones"" was a good episode. It was funny in the way that Mad Men usually is, it was gorgeously filmed and impeccably acted, and it was deceptively sad. In other words, it was quintessential Mad Men.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5734,Mad Men,1,"Answers will come. Actions will be taken. We just don't know when, how, or by whom. Embrace the intrigue, the subtle shifts in character, and Weiner's careful plotting.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5735,Mad Men,1,It's fantastic to have this conversation piece back on a weekly basis.,VUDU,94%,96%,61

5737,Mad Men,1,"It's well-written, and beautifully framed, and we see some characters who have evolved considerably already, and are on clear paths to change even more, along with the times themselves.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5738,Mad Men,0,Each season is starting to resemble an animated cartoon where the same landscape rolls by over and over again. We've seen a lot of these story lines before.,VUDU,94%,96%,61
5739,Mad Men,1,"As fans obsess over every nuance of new Mad Men episodes, I hope the show answers one of our biggest questions: whether Draper can find peace in a truthful life or will surrender to the lies.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5740,Mad Men,1,I was tickled by a surprise twist near the end of the episode that sets up some delicious skulduggery to come.,VUDU,94%,96%,61
5741,Mad Men,1,"We won't be able to fully appreciate it from moment to moment, because we're so eager to learn what's coming next, to get to whatever the future holds. But that future is a world without Mad Men, so let's not get there too fast.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5742,Mad Men,1,The equivalence of Don and Freddy is actually far more pronounced than previously imagined.,VUDU,94%,96%,61
5743,Mad Men,1,"On a show all about advertising and projecting a certain image, it's very entertaining when the show can actually play with the idea of how the media can sell us something.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5744,Mad Men,1,"This is a show that loves ambiguities, digressions and oblique angles. Not many shows could pull that off, but Mad Men has the kind of cast that makes watching people think and react a real pleasure most of the time.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5745,Mad Men,0,"Gone are the days of ""Zou Bisou Bisou"" and Don's Hawaiian mortality freak-out. Nope. This season premiere, all we got was a cold pastrami sandwich with coleslaw smeared on the bread.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5746,Mad Men,0,The characters got the wake-up calls last season. The writers need one this season.,VUDU,94%,96%,61

5748,Mad Men,1,"Mad Men is always aware of its own bigness; it's deep, but it's also cool and crowd-pleasing.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5749,Mad Men,1,Don Draper's introduction is one of my favorite things about this episode.,VUDU,94%,96%,61
5750,Mad Men,1,"A new day is approaching, and Don seems unprepared for what lies ahead.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5751,Mad Men,0,"With each new season, I try to remind myself that the show is a slow burn. The first episode wasn't as glacial as the first episode of last season, but it still dragged a bit.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5752,Mad Men,1,"Characters, settings, and levels of cool are all swapped out indiscriminately, leaving us to piece together the real situation only as fast as Hornbacher and Matthew Weiner (on script duty) allow it.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5753,Mad Men,1,"Tonight's episode felt lighter than Mad Men has been in a long time, as though Don coming clean had lifted a weight off the entire series.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5754,Mad Men,1,"It's too early to tell, too early even to smell the smoke, but in the meantime, we'll wait for things to heat up. Because this is the beginning of something.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5755,Mad Men,1,"Here's a prediction about the final season: Peggy is the one to watch. Her journey is the one people are going to be blogging, tweeting and talking about.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5756,Mad Men,1,"It's an excellent starting point for an episode that, even more than the average Mad Men premiere, has to spend an awful lot of time (especially given that it's our first one-hour premiere in a few years) filling us in on what happened during the hiatus.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5757,Mad Men,1,"Welcome back, Mad Men, you old day brightener, you.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5758,Mad Men,1,"Even though its opener is moody and a bit muddled, Mad Men still brims with sex, symbolism and surprises, as well as television's finest ensemble.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5759,Mad Men,1,It's as watchable as ever.,VUDU,94%,96%,61
5760,Mad Men,1,"Let's just say that if last season left you wondering whether the time had come to bail, tonight's premiere may convince you to wait at least a few more weeks before you decide.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5761,Mad Men,1,"In the often bleak world of Mad Men, the women are stealing the spotlight, and that's not such a bad thing.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5762,Mad Men,1,"The show has nothing to teach us. It's just being honest about the truths people discover and then disregard, and the lies they tell themselves, as history moves around them. They're doing the best they can.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5763,Mad Men,1,"The writing, by Weiner, direction by Scott Hornbacher and performances are, of course, top-notch.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5764,Mad Men,1,"It's the fetishizing of the visual, not lack of action, that leaves me impatient. But for now, we're on a plane and Weiner's in the cockpit... I don't know where we're going and neither do you. Might as well sit back and enjoy what's left of the ride.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5765,Mad Men,0,The season premiere seems as exhausted as the decade it has chronicled so intensely.,VUDU,94%,96%,61
5766,Mad Men,1,"Mad Men is beautifully shot as always, with the dialogue flowing naturally and meaningfully over alcohol... The pace hasn't quickened. Nor does the storyline congeal. Instead, Sunday's re-opener builds to a terrifically poignant finish.",VUDU,94%,96%,61
5767,Mad Men,1,"Wherever this American saga is taking us, the getting there is likely to be exhilarating.",VUDU,94%,96%,61

5774,13 Reasons Why,1,"While season four has its bumps in the road, the lens does not falter, keeping its focus locked on the wreckage these teens not only create for themselves but the issues the world has created for them.",VUDU,35%,57%,12
5775,13 Reasons Why,0,The team behind 13 Reasons Why had no way of knowing that audiences would be watching this season in the middle of a pandemic. But that only makes the sadistic nature of the material that much more glaring.,VUDU,35%,57%,12
5776,13 Reasons Why,0,"The show's myopia isn't surprising. If anything, the final season proves once again that teen viewers deserved better than what 13 Reasons Why offered, and if the show is remembered in a few years, it'll be mostly for what it failed to do.",VUDU,35%,57%,12

5788,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,0,"The final season was a chance for the show to engage in some systemic critique; its attempts to do so, however, largely fell flat... A soft-pedaled version of policing and the people who do it.",VUDU,95%,87%,28
5789,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"It was a warm-hearted, densely crafted comedy that was one of the networks' last decent originals. Fortunately, the two-part finale did the series justice, and you should check it out if you were ever a fan.",VUDU,95%,87%,28
5790,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,0,"There will surely be some watchable gags... but between the consistently uncertain run and a world that has seen such a substantial shift in mindset, it's safe to say that viewers are more than ready to say goodbye.",VUDU,95%,87%,28

5793,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,It somehow manages to be topical and ridiculous; on-trend and off-kilter.,VUDU,95%,87%,28

5797,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"Season 8 of Brooklyn Nine-Nine wasn't the triumphant victory lap that it should have been, but ""The Last Day"" absolutely sends off our favorite precinct with grace, humor, and heart.",VUDU,95%,87%,28
5798,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"Ultimately, the series finale delivered on everything we've come to expect from Brooklyn Nine-Nine: plenty of humor, plenty of heart, and a soulful and satisfying farewell to a warm and wonderful series. NINE-NINE!",VUDU,95%,87%,28
5799,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,The final season of Brooklyn Nine-Nine came with intense pressure to deliver humor while also reflecting the changed world it inhabits.,VUDU,95%,87%,28

5801,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"There's not a lot of runway left before the end of the series but if anyone is able to thoughtfully balance the big questions with the demands of a weekly comedy, it's going to be the Brooklyn Nine-Nine writers.",VUDU,95%,87%,28
5802,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,[Provides] a parade of comedy while also leaning into serious socio-political issues. It deftly navigates this tricky balance all while making sure each character remains true to their own personalities and motivations.,VUDU,95%,87%,28

5805,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"I don't want to applaud the show for doing the right thing, but more so for ditching the work they'd done thus far in favor of a story that really examines the police and its role in society.",VUDU,95%,87%,28
5806,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"While culturally relevant, ""The Good Ones"" and Brooklyn Nine-Nine's approach to what's going on in the world kind of implode upon themself, thanks to the previous seven seasons of the series.",VUDU,95%,87%,28
5807,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"Brooklyn Nine-Nine does the best job possible of acknowledging the problem with portraying cops as uncomplicated heroes while still remaining a good-natured, funny show, but it feels fitting, and fortunate, that this is its final season.",VUDU,95%,87%,28
5808,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"These episodes are just as joke-dense and fun as their funniest pre-Season 8 episodes have been, everyone from the main cast down to the guest stars putting in their full 9-9%.",VUDU,95%,87%,28
5809,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"Nine-Nine's final season occasionally feels like one big hedged bet, banking on its audience's love for its characters to get them through one last batch of good-natured adventures. That's the kicker: even through these pains, the show is still fun.",VUDU,95%,87%,28

5812,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,I'm happy that a sitcom that's delivered so many hard laughs over the years has had the chance to go out on its own terms - nudging its audience toward a greater awareness of what other cop shows are trying to sell in the process.,VUDU,95%,87%,28
5813,Legion,1,"With three seasons and barely 30 episodes, Legion was nothing if not a feat of visual artistry, a meditation on the human mind that necessitated engaging our own in order to participate.",VUDU,91%,86%,27

5822,Legion,1,"If you've jumped off the ride at some point over the past two years, do yourself a favour and hop back on the merry-go-round for this final season of Legion.",VUDU,91%,86%,27
5823,Legion,1,"In a more just world, Legion would be the stuff of conversations at water coolers, or wherever people gather to discuss the amazing these days.",VUDU,91%,86%,27
5824,Legion,1,"Its final season premiere advances the plot while swimming in pure psychedelia. Trippy but not senseless... the real fun is in deciphering the plot puzzles, verbal games and visual clues as the storyline hurtles towards finally doing some time travel.",VUDU,91%,86%,27
5825,Legion,1,"The loopy digressions are as vivid as ever... But there's also solid character development, inventive depictions of mutant powers, a delightful bit of mime from Bill Irwin and at least one genuine narrative surprise.",VUDU,91%,86%,27
5826,Legion,0,"PowerPoint surrealism hiding a total lack of imagination. Deaths don't matter, as the timeline fractures across illusions and flashbacks. There's yet another toothy shadow monster. David's face appears on lunchboxes: Mmmm, yessss, ironic merchandise.",VUDU,91%,86%,27

5828,Legion,1,"The third season of ""Legion"" is one of those experiences where even after two stellar seasons you cannot believe [Noah] Hawley and his colleagues have the guts to try and pull off one unexpected moment after another.",VUDU,91%,86%,27
5829,Legion,1,"There are enough hallucinogenic thrills in Legion's third season to keep the rest of it from falling apart, even as time travel threatens to force the characters to do that very thing.",VUDU,91%,86%,27
5830,Legion,1,"[Noah] Hawley's faithfulness to being as weird and infuriating as possible until the end is admirable. And when it's working, as it does so often throughout season 3, it's easy to get swept up in the freewheeling creativity of it all.",VUDU,91%,86%,27
5831,Legion,0,Legion is weird for weird's sake and seems content to do that right up to the end.,VUDU,91%,86%,27

5833,Legion,1,Legion remains an intoxicating experience laced with a grand sense of wonder. The humorous touches are every bit as clever as the visual treats. The performances are every bit as compelling as the production team's command of the narrative.,VUDU,91%,86%,27
5834,Legion,1,"Even if ""Legion"" isn't the sum of its parts, some of those parts are spectacular on their own.",VUDU,91%,86%,27
5835,Legion,1,"If nothing else, the final season feels primed to anchor its lofty visual aspirations with a story that may well satisfy those who enjoy the show for what it is, and those who are hungry for a meatier story.",VUDU,91%,86%,27
5836,Legion,1,"Legion is quite possibly the most beautiful show on television, with stunning visuals giving the eyes plenty to digest while leaving the mind dazzled and bewildered.",VUDU,91%,86%,27

5841,Justified,1,"A pitch-perfect ending to one of TV's best, often-overlooked dramas.",VUDU,97%,95%,25
5842,Justified,1,Justified called it quits and went out with a finale that was as unpredictable and poetic and entertaining and memorable as the series itself. What a triumph.,VUDU,97%,95%,25
5843,Justified,1,"... there's nothing predictable about the direction of the story or the characters, who are layered in levels of loyalty and honor and self-interest.",VUDU,97%,95%,25
5844,Justified,1,"Somehow, over six seasons, the show's producers have retained the style and attitude of their source material to craft a smart, engaging modern day Western that feels classic as a John Wayne shoot 'em up and modern as the next season of True Detective.",VUDU,97%,95%,25
5845,Justified,1,"Justified's soul rests not in its heart, but at its hip, right next to the gun holster.",VUDU,97%,95%,25
5846,Justified,1,"As much as I liked Olyphant in Deadwood, it's hard to think of him as anyone but Raylan.",VUDU,97%,95%,25
5847,Justified,1,"We know Raylan can't remain a good boy for very long. Indeed, we count upon his random acts of violent justice, just as we are made eager for Boyd's random acts of violent retribution, to give the show its juice.",VUDU,97%,95%,25
5848,Justified,1,"From the way season 6 begins, it looks like Justified is going out with a bang.",VUDU,97%,95%,25
5849,Justified,1,"The neo-Western's end is here at last, and the guns are mostly blazing.",VUDU,97%,95%,25
5850,Justified,1,It is emphatically a show to relish.,VUDU,97%,95%,25
5851,Justified,1,"The final season is primed to explore what the end means for Raylan, Boyd, and Ava, and whether or not the good days are truly gone forever.",VUDU,97%,95%,25
5852,Justified,1,There's a definite sense that the show is consciously returning to its core strengths.,VUDU,97%,95%,25
5853,Justified,1,"Although the program isn't as showy or heralded as the network's other dramas, its sixth-season start reinforces a sense that Justified will be sorely missed when it rides into the sunset.",VUDU,97%,95%,25
5854,Justified,1,"It's interesting to see just how self-aware the premiere episode is with all the talk of Harlan practically a remnant of what it used to be, of moments in the past and the recognition of things all wrapping up.",VUDU,97%,95%,25
5855,Justified,1,"Justified's love of the wacky short-story character ... has made it funnier and less self-serious than other superficially similar antihero shows, but it has also made it dunderheaded.",VUDU,97%,95%,25
5856,Justified,1,"Justified is again fun and scary and thrilling -- in some ways more, because both the show and the people on it know how little time they have left.",VUDU,97%,95%,25

5858,Justified,1,"We will know for sure in 12 weeks, but we sure are off to a good start.",VUDU,97%,95%,25
5859,Justified,1,"Raylan vs. Boyd begins, as the electric first hour of Justified's final season proves that the only thing deadlier than the present is getting lost in the past.",VUDU,97%,95%,25
5860,Justified,1,"The greatest compliment I can pay Justified is to say that, despite the fact that it arrived at the height of the anti-hero boom, it never felt like a copycat. The drama created a vibrant, funny, tragic world of its own.",VUDU,97%,95%,25
5861,Justified,1,There must be an alternate universe where Justified is fully recognized for what it is: one of the greatest shows in television history.,VUDU,97%,95%,25
5862,Justified,1,"Elmore Leonard loved this series based on his novella ""Fire in the Hole,"" and Justified does him proud to the end.",VUDU,97%,95%,25
5863,Justified,1,"With ""Fate,"" as usual, the best stuff with Justified is often the little stuff: a stray word of dialogue, an Olyphant glance from under the shadow of that Stetson Marshall hat, Goggins' hair. Oh yes, the hair.",VUDU,97%,95%,25
5864,Justified,1,One of the great things about this noir-western hybrid is its interest in updating more than just the superficial tropes of those genres.,VUDU,97%,95%,25
5865,Prison Break,1,This season promises plenty of action in some real-world parallels...,VUDU,61%,78%,34
5866,Prison Break,1,"I was fascinated the entire time and thought there were a great amount of plot twists. There was a character for everyone. No one was quite like the other, which definitely added to the beauty of this show.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5867,Prison Break,0,"My hope is that this will satisfy whatever itch the show's die-hards had to elicit this revival, if only to finally put an end to all of this.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5868,Prison Break,0,"The reality is that Prison Break in 2017 is basically a collection of ideas that Homeland passed on, if you can imagine that.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5869,Prison Break,1,"Moving the action to Yemen and a city thrown into chaos by ISIL made the show relevant, if not far-fetched. You do wonder how far realistically Lincoln would get in his search, but you care enough about the characters to let it slide.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5870,Prison Break,1,"For a 45-minute blast of nostalgia or a bit of (literal) escapism, Prison Break does the job. Just make sure you've suspended your disbelief before you watch.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5871,Prison Break,1,Solid series revival is true to the original crime story.,VUDU,61%,78%,34
5872,Prison Break,1,"Prison Break in a nutshell: It's ridiculous, it makes no sense, but it's watchable because you need to find out answers.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5873,Prison Break,1,"Prison Break is a very special roller coaster ride that lives by its own rules, and not much seems to have changed from the franchise's later seasons. That's a good thing for fans of the original, but for everyone else? I'm not sure.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5874,Prison Break,0,This was most definitely not the way I wanted nor expected season five to get underway. But here's hoping somehow the show is able to catch its footing because Ogygia was a complete and utter letdown.,VUDU,61%,78%,34
5875,Prison Break,0,"As is so often the case, creating buzz worthy content doesn't necessarily translate into content that justifies its existence beyond causing a stir. That's largely how Prison Break feels.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5876,Prison Break,0,"Prison Break isn't worth much of anything, but it could have been. You can see the better show trying to escape its lock-up of bad ideas.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5877,Prison Break,1,"But while TV in general has changed, Prison Break really hasn't, as seen in tonight's season premiere. Billed as an event series, the show remains true to its goofy nature, with just a few surprises thrown into the mix.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5878,Prison Break,1,"The show is as fast-moving as ever, with a trio that includes Sucre and C-Note all heading to super-dangerous Yemen to plan another big breakout as promised in the title.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5879,Prison Break,0,"The question remains: Other than an effort to goose ratings with the return of a familiar title, is there really any creative reason for more Prison Break? Probably not.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5880,Prison Break,0,The not-so-good news about Prison Break is that the suspension of disbelief it requires is simply a bridge too far.,VUDU,61%,78%,34
5881,Prison Break,0,"It's utter nonsense. Mind-numbingly stupid. Worse yet, it's a bore.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5882,Prison Break,0,The nostalgia works against the show.,VUDU,61%,78%,34
5883,Prison Break,0,"More than a new installment of Prison Break, this season feels a bit like Homeland For Dummies, with the political intrigue and intelligence-community backstabbing brought down to a grade-school level.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5884,Prison Break,0,"This show was junk food, and proud of it. That's what makes Prison Break's return as a nine-episode miniseries so baffling: Now, the show wants to mean something. And it's horrible.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5885,Prison Break,0,"Fox's revival, alas, begins with a flawed blueprint, while suffering from a been-there, broke-out-of-that quality.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5886,Prison Break,0,"In a particularly generous (or perverse) move, Fox is giving us not just a dead show or a dead character, but a two-for-one sale.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5887,Prison Break,0,"Once the thrill of becoming reacquainted wears off, you're left with a somewhat muddled, not at all credible yarn.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5888,Prison Break,1,"With the action going from 0 to 80 m.p.h. about 10 minutes into the premiere, this Prison Break wants to recapture its old urgency -- and some of its old fans will likely stick around for the ride.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5889,Prison Break,1,It may take a little while to get going but trust me; it's worth the wait. By the end you'll be wishing you could binge watch the whole season on Netflix.,VUDU,61%,78%,34
5890,Prison Break,1,"At its best, Prison Break is kind of the Fast & Furious of episodic television -- not taking itself too seriously and providing equal amounts of crazy plot twists, action sequences and cheesy dialogue.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5891,Prison Break,1,"Although the Prison Break revival came close several times to self-parody, the reunion of Lincoln, Michael, Sara, and the rest of the original characters had enough power to carry the show through its sillier moments.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5892,Prison Break,1,"Some whoppers in terms of story and logic, but this is the long-awaited fifth season of Prison Break, after all. You expected otherwise? A solid start.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5893,Prison Break,0,"There's a reason the phrase ""You can't go home again"" amounts to a cliché. You really can't. Especially when home is a prison.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5894,Prison Break,1,"A strong start to Prison Break's long overdue revival, if the show stays this enjoyable, fans are in for a real treat.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5895,Prison Break,1,"After seeing all the badass brawls and jaw-dropping shocks that happen in the early part of the season, I'd have to be behind bars to stop from watching everything else that happens. I need answers as badly as Linc does.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5896,Prison Break,1,"After a crackling good start, Prison Break begins to wobble but doesn't quite topple in succeeding hours.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5897,Prison Break,1,"Everyone from the writers to the actors committed to the outlandish nature of the show's later years, and this is where the newest run of episodes squarely lives... and unlike The X-Files, this conspiracy is fun to watch.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5898,Prison Break,1,"Prison Break is at its best when it's an escapist jaunt graced with a few characters and relationships with energy and texture, but the drama finds it quite difficult to establish that groove this time out.",VUDU,61%,78%,34
5899,Community,1,Community is unique. There has never been a sitcom quite like it.,VUDU,88%,88%,37
5900,Community,0,"The last season of Community was really, truly awful. I mean, it crashed and burned. And for a show as self-aware as this one, there's no way it didn't know it.",VUDU,88%,88%,37
5901,Community,1,"There's no denying that the magic of the early seasons isn't quite there. However, let's be very clear about this: There is much greatness and joy to be found in those 13 episodes.",VUDU,88%,88%,37

6179,House of Cards,1,"The one story line that towers over all others is the one about gender with Claire Underwood as president of the United States.. It makes the finale feel far more resonant, culturally important and compelling than I expected it to.",VUDU,77%,76%,68
6180,House of Cards,1,"Ultimately I liked it, because it was revision of a series that I once enjoyed very much that had been tainted by the action of an actor and how the political climate evolved. It felt familiar and felt like a good way to end the show on its own terms.",VUDU,77%,76%,68
6181,House of Cards,1,"As we saw last season, politics is faster than this now, an endless churn of scandal and grotesquery, and House Of Cards remains its own chilly, composed self.",VUDU,77%,76%,68
6182,House of Cards,0,"In the moments when Claire is allowed not just the camera but the story, ""House of Cards"" is a ride; when the past is relitigated and the specter of Frank rears up once more, it feels like that worst thing a binge-able drama can be: a trudge.",VUDU,77%,76%,68
6183,House of Cards,0,"Despite the hype, Season 6 isn't Claire's show. It's still Frank's, which undercuts the season's many attempts at women-first stories and keeps momentum stagnant.",VUDU,77%,76%,68
6184,House of Cards,1,"Both in scope and detail, House of Cards remains impressive, and it probably goes without saying that both Lane and Kinnear are superb.",VUDU,77%,76%,68
6185,House of Cards,1,"House of Cards Season 6 is a bit of a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. And after investing five seasons in this show, it's one I'm happy exists.",VUDU,77%,76%,68
6186,House of Cards,1,"So House of Cards Season 6 is a must-watch. It's serving a bombastic, oversized, absurdist end to Netflix's first major original drama. And I'm okay with that.",VUDU,77%,76%,68

6189,House of Cards,1,The old show was one I've disliked for a long time. The newer show is one I can imagine missing. I wish there were some way the ties could have been severed immediately.,VUDU,77%,76%,68
6190,House of Cards,1,"A nicely labyrinthine plot means the season is far from a complete failure. But with Wright required to carry the entire enterprise, Netflix's first global hit looks set to limp into the sunset rather than triumphantly take its bows.",VUDU,77%,76%,68
6191,House of Cards,1,"In its final season, the Netflix drama, which now has Robin Wright in the lead, is the best it's been in years.",VUDU,77%,76%,68
6192,House of Cards,1,Robin Wright is so damn good at playing this character that I really wish they had found a better way to showcase her talents. House of Cards was a great show that turned into a good one. This final season is good but could have been great.,VUDU,77%,76%,68

6203,Forever,1,"It is, after all, a mystery-of-the-week show modeled on the latest hot character trope, but it is surprisingly endearing and entertaining, with a long-form mythology that gets doled out bit by bit each week.",VUDU,95%,78%,36

6220,Forever,1,"Forever sets up a base camp on that line between intimacy and familiarity, determined not to broaden its characters into familiar TV-couple types.",VUDU,95%,78%,36

6285,Loot,1,Loot feels like two polar opposite shows grafted into one awkward enterprise that doesn’t fit. What exists is a sitcom that’s far below the talents of everyone involved. It’s not bad; it’s just a show with a hefty production budget but no depth.,Apple TV+,80%,65%,42

6590,Foundation,1,"If the series is passionate about anything, it's the uplifting clarity of science and math... One scene starring Gaal is a literal math montage that's as sensual as anything that happens in bed.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86

6592,Foundation,0,"""Foundation"" has the space for Asimov's seemingly endless plot points to breathe. Even so, it's much to take in, though creators David S. Goyer and Josh Friedman deserve kudos for making the effort at achieving the impossible.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6593,Foundation,0,"Foundation attempts to achieve as many plot points as possible from the beginning, which is concerning early on. Hopefully, the jittery exposition is only served to launch the series, and the story improves from here.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6594,Foundation,0,"Lacking wit or self-awareness, Goyer's robot future is every bit as cold as you'd expect from a space adventure that's actually all about algebra.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86

6598,Foundation,1,"Foundation has achieved the impossible, bringing Asimov's universe to the small screen with coherence and flexibility. [Full Review in Spanish]",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6599,Foundation,0,"Whether Foundation works for you is going to depend on your mileage for sci-fi. If you're a dedicated junkie, already conversant in either Asimov's writings or in the genre tropes, it's likely a lot easier to digest.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6600,Foundation,1,"There is a lot to unpack here and I found that with each subsequent episode I was more invested in the story, but I am not sure if general audiences will be invested enough to see this through to the end.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6601,Foundation,1,"The opening two episodes of Foundation are extremely promising, covering a lot of ground and leaving you desperate to see where the story will go, as well as delivering some earthshaking shock moments.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6602,Foundation,0,"I find myself less enthusiastic about spending hours watching a series gear up for the good stuff, especially when the material is as sombre as this.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6603,Foundation,1,"Great sci-fi sends the mind and heart racing, and 'Foundation' does exactly that.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6604,Foundation,1,"Sprawling and convoluted, yet completely coherent once you gauge the cadence and tone, there are few programs capable of coming close to this level of reality.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6605,Foundation,1,"The two other most compelling characters are easily those played by Lee Pace and Jared Harris. Whenever these two actors are giving elaborate speeches or chewing the scenery, Foundation soars to its epic science-fiction heights.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6606,Foundation,1,"At this point the acting and script are standard for the genre: neutral, passionless, rising to a light pomposity. For the moment it's left to Pace and Harris to strike all the sparks.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86

6610,Foundation,1,One of the most impressive feats Foundation pulls off is never letting you forget it is individuals affected by galaxy-wide events.,Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6611,Foundation,0,"Not much about Foundation sticks, either emotionally or narratively. There are cause-and-effect relationships between one event and another, but they're stretched across long-attenuated frames.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6612,Foundation,1,"A gorgeous, overcomplicated Isaac Asimov adaptation about the collapse of an empire. It won't be a ratings hit, but it certainly drew me in.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6613,Foundation,1,"""Foundation"" is incredible to look at. The visuals are spectacular.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6614,Foundation,1,The series certainly feels as though it's been constructed by people with a love for Asimov's writing.,Apple TV+,71%,58%,86

6616,Foundation,1,"We shouldn't have to sit through hours of TV that makes our heads spin to get to stuff like this, that entertains and challenges us. But in this case, the patience does pay off.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6617,Foundation,1,The performances are staggering. Lee Pace is jaw-dropping as the Galactic Emperor Brother Day. Jared Harris portrays the role of Hari Seldon as if he's actually lived the character's life and Lou Llobell is unstoppable.,Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6618,Foundation,1,Foundation has very much started to reward the effort and developed a habit of ending episodes with breathless cliffhangers that practically dare viewers to stop watching.,Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6619,Foundation,1,"When ""Foundation"" draws on that core, and manages to make discussions of those questions more intuitive than didactic, it's invigorating to see so many component parts work in tandem.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6620,Foundation,1,Foundation's set and costume designs are more impressive than many feature film projects. This is an expansive sci-fi story told in ten parts that feel limitless.,Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6621,Foundation,1,"Packed with massive starships, sprawling vistas, slick technology, and incredibly imaginative costumes, it's a big -- and clearly big-budget -- affair that could easily stand up against any silver-screen sci-fi epic.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6622,Foundation,1,"Foundation is reminiscent of many science fiction works, the most obvious being Star Wars. It's not super exciting, but it's visuals and acting make for a captivating space tale.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6623,Foundation,0,"We'd love to see the parts that show the story's humanity and hope, but the first episode was just too boring to draw us in.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6624,Foundation,1,"Not just an adaptation of a long-revered work of science fiction, but a thoughtful, provocative, consistently compelling series worthy of the investment in time and effort to reach the final moments of its ten-hour running time.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6625,Foundation,1,"Foundation's ten episodes are sumptuous TV and showrunner David S. Goyer has successfully brought an extremely difficult book series to life on the screen, even if it doesn't really feel much like the original source material.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6626,Foundation,0,"As with some of Apple's other high budget series, the desire to look massive overtakes a lean narrative... This is probably the priciest slow burner show ever made.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6627,Foundation,1,"Sometimes the mood is deliberately lightened, clearly to aid accessibility, and when it is, the tone clashes jarringly ... [but] it feels mostly respectful to Asimov's tone and story, which may make it good for the fans and incomprehensible to [others].",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6628,Foundation,1,I feel like it's a partial realization... it's straying quite a bit away from the Foundation idea while still trying to do cerebral science fiction.,Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6629,Foundation,1,"I'll just thank the science-fiction gods that Foundation, often considered an impossible-to-adapt Isaac Asimov property, received such a lavish, compelling treatment.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86

6633,Foundation,1,"Its emotional expanse ... is a bit more of a question, but the show sucks you in a great deal.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6634,Foundation,1,Season one comes off as a 10-episode pilot for later seasons - one just good enough for us to want to stick with the show. But the sluggish storytelling suggests there were good reasons Asimov's books did not make it to screen before.,Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6635,Foundation,0,"There is no saga too epic for a little levity, and here it might have made some of the characters more believable. It might even have made me want to wade through the complexity.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6636,Foundation,0,"The time jumps are confusing and the story needs a clearer arc. It doesn't feel immersive enough and, absent the texture of everyday life, the stakes feel too theoretical. The editing is clunky and the show lacks a sense of humor.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6637,Foundation,1,Foundation is a promising but cautious piece of sci-fi epic storytelling.,Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6638,Foundation,1,"The fantastical settings and epic scope make it closer in feel to Thrones, but the need for patience as things develop hews much closer to Simon's snowballing exploration of crime, culture, and community in Baltimore.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6639,Foundation,1,"Remixing Asimov's characters, settings and themes into something more timely and fitting for television versus the page, this iteration of ""Foundation"" thrives most when becoming something all its own.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6640,Foundation,1,"""Foundation"" has been reinvented as something more accessible, more vibrant, more action-driven, sexier, and yes, more fun in the traditional sense of the word.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6641,Foundation,0,"The dense, at-times muddled narrative offers little to warrant the enthusiasm to justify that, leaving behind an impenetrable show that looks like several million bucks but feels as if it lacks the tools to save itself, much less all mankind.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6642,Foundation,0,"While shows don't need to hold our hands or slowly spoon-feed us information, they do need to help us follow along. No one enjoys feeling like they're missing something, but that's exactly what happens as you sit down to watch these episodes.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6643,Foundation,1,"The result is an adaptation that's generally faithful to Asimov's original work, but that also expands on events in interesting ways that the exposition-heavy novel didn't in 1951.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6644,Foundation,0,The show's starry-eyed ambitions are dulled by its execution. Its scattered focus stalls momentum by introducing and discarding characters like a wad of receipts found in your back pocket after a night on the town.,Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6645,Foundation,1,"Even as Foundation stumbles throughout its execution, it still maintains a grip on the unconditional hope of its characters.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86

6651,Foundation,0,"For people who know or are fans of Isaac Asimov and his work, I feel compelled to warn you that if you watch the show you will see a scene so enraging that you will tear your TV in two with your bare hands.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6652,Foundation,1,"""Foundation"" jumps back and forth in time and from one world to another as it breaks into myriad storylines. It does initially seem a bit too enthralled with bloated world-building but things pick up as they splinter.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6653,Foundation,0,"Beneath the gunplay and C.G.I., there's a much weirder show struggling to get out, about statistics and space popes, decadent clone emperors and millennia-old robots.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6654,Foundation,0,The individual parts of this Foundation equation add up to something that's very pretty and slightly dull. Asimov's books have long been considered impossible to adapt. This version is a noble effort that can't quite solve the problem.,Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6655,Foundation,1,"Perhaps the best aspect of Foundation, beyond all the money spent on sets and effects, is the amount of humanity that's allowed to thrive on screen.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6656,Foundation,0,"As a new sci-fi show, it would be fine. As a big-budget, flagship production for Apple it looks like a fine opportunity wasted.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6657,Foundation,1,"While it delivers in both scope and spectacle, Foundation is not for the faint-hearted. This is a slice of rock-hard sci-fi that tickles the intellect with concepts both philosophical and profound.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6658,Foundation,1,Conjures up its own vision for what might happen.,Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6659,Foundation,1,"Foundation isn't sure if it wants to be a philosophic metaphor for war and why we should listen to the thinkers not the shooters, or if it wants to be a sexed-up sci-fi about revolutionaries carrying on a movement long after the founder has gone.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6660,Foundation,0,"Foundation isn't based on the books, it's inspired by them. In other words, Foundation merely serves as a - excuse me - foundation for the TV show. I just wish its foundation, the first season, had a better idea of what it wanted to be.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6661,Foundation,1,"With a sumptuous big-budget production, enigmatic performances & a compelling examination of the human condition, Apple TV+ has another hit on their hands.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6662,Foundation,0,"Spanning a millennium and juggling at least half-a-dozen narratives at any given moment, Foundation is suitably epic to behold, but has the emotional intensity of a lecture on particle physics.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86
6663,Foundation,1,"Outside of aesthetic considerations, the series' first two episodes focus on themes that are both poignant and agonizingly familiar.",Apple TV+,71%,58%,86

6676,WeCrashed,1,"WeCrashed is almost singularly focused on Adam Neumann (Jared Leto), for better and for worse - he's a compelling character, but for WeCrashed to work as an eight-hour television drama it needs to broaden its scope.",Apple TV+,65%,78%,46
6677,WeCrashed,0,"This meaty showcase for Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway is wrapped in a somewhat malnourished limited series, with the misfortune of coming at the tail end of several better productions about high-stakes startups whose founders flew too close to the sun.",Apple TV+,65%,78%,46

6680,WeCrashed,1,"It's hard to look away from ""WeCrashed"" – although there are plenty of cringe-worthy moments that may make viewers avert their eyes. Even if you know how the WeWork story ends, it's an enthralling ride to the inevitable implosion.",Apple TV+,65%,78%,46

6711,WeCrashed,1,'WeCrashed' gives a great crash course (pun intended) into the origin story of Adam Neumann and what he did for the co-working space. The series is filled with brilliant performances by both Leto and Hathaway and offers a memorable quirky soundtrack.,Apple TV+,65%,78%,46

7231,Mr. Corman,0,Spending five-plus hours watching a very average man inch toward slightly greater self-awareness doesn't make for the most powerful TV experience.,Apple TV+,70%,67%,40

8360,Twin Peaks,1,When watching everything just... fits.,Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8361,Twin Peaks,1,"The new series was exactly as we should have expected -- not like the original or the follow-up as fans had speculated but a continuation of the two, although still absolutely modern and unique.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8362,Twin Peaks,1,"I have no idea what I just witnessed. I don't mean to be cute; I don't know exactly what to say about an intrinsically weird series that returned twenty-five years later, as esoteric as ever.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8363,Twin Peaks,1,David Lynch's cult-classic revival is exactly as imaginative-and as uncomfortable-as it always needed to be.,Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8364,Twin Peaks,1,"Those wanting answers, or in the very least closure, might understandably feel a little adrift right now, but it can't be denied that Peaks came back as a true artistic force that challenged just about every storytelling convention we know.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8365,Twin Peaks,1,"That's what Twin Peaks might be, after it's all said and done. Not a detective caper, or gumshoe sendup, not a celebration of American tropes from diners to police stations, but strictly Dada.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8366,Twin Peaks,1,"It stopped feeling like a TV show to me, at some point, and started feeling like a gift.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8367,Twin Peaks,1,As wayyy out there as Twin Peaks can get -- and it zoomed even farther beyond the outer limits than I thought it would this season -- watching it can still be remarkably personal.,Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8368,Twin Peaks,1,What we just witnessed was unmatched in the medium's history.,Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8369,Twin Peaks,1,"[David lynch] has burst out of the glass box of kitschy remembrance. . .giving us the brilliant, the slick, the sick; the weird, of course, but the deeply human that made Twin Peaks so special all those years ago.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8370,Twin Peaks,1,"The Return isn't a true follow-up to Twin Peaks. It's something bigger, stranger, and far more interesting.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8371,Twin Peaks,1,"Twin Peaks: Return feels like hard work, like taking a three hundred level abstract art class when you have a load of 21 credits. The show makes my mind hurt! Yet, I find that I can't take my eyes off the screen when it's on.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8372,Twin Peaks,1,"[Lynch is] in experimental filmmaker mode and he doesn't care if he's liked or not or who's coming with him. Everyone wanted the nostalgia thing, and it's not that. Now every character has many doppelgangers, and every character is in every dimension.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8373,Twin Peaks,0,"I'm a fan of TV that breaks the rules. But for me, there are minimum requirements for coherence. And Twin Peaks is self-indulgently messing with viewers.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8374,Twin Peaks,1,I love Twin Peaks because it represents David Lynch at his most gleefully ornery. The man can do whatever he likes. I'm in deep.,Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8375,Twin Peaks,1,"When a multimedia phenomenon comes as heavily coded as this, the onus is on the viewer to piece together all its oddball fragments and episodic epiphanies into a coherent whole, as if such deciphering might lead to... a grand theory of everything.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8376,Twin Peaks,1,"It does make me think about what sort of person I am, and how I want to respond to the unsteady ground around me.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8377,Twin Peaks,1,"The Twin Peaks revival is perfect. I'm in deep with it. It's easily the best series of the year so far. And, although this might seem like heresy to long-time fans, I think it might actually be better than the original.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8378,Twin Peaks,1,"Four episodes in, it's already delivering a recognizably addictive mix of the macabre, the quotidian, the folksy, the soapy, the sick, the surreal, and the downright weird. It may be even better than 1990's revelatory first season.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8379,Twin Peaks,1,"This is an altogether shiftier beast, haunting and beautiful when it wants to be; ugly and aggressively off-putting when it doesn't.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8380,Twin Peaks,1,"This is an entertaining and intriguing return to form that will delight fans and maybe-just maybe-pull in a new audience happy to overlook the slow pace and random non sequiturs in return for a glimpse into Lynch's inimitable, magical, dystopian world.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8381,Twin Peaks,1,"Above all, the new Twin Peaks is gloriously trippy.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8382,Twin Peaks,0,"A collection of rambling and samey set pieces amateurishly glued together by a frankly adolescent conviction that weirdness in any form -- hey, let's not bother with a plot -- can pass for clever and interesting, it should never have been made.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8383,Twin Peaks,1,"Yes, I think Mr Lynch may have done it again. Just call me a Peaks freak, but I think I know what's going on, or will in about 25 years; for the moment, jes' enjoying the ride, ma'am, and hugely.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8384,Twin Peaks,1,This doesn't feel like the Twin Peaks we know and love and that's because it's not.,Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8385,Twin Peaks,1,It's a credit to Lynch that he has not adapted his style to suit TV's more muted sensibilities (even in this Golden Age) but remained true to what he does best.,Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8386,Twin Peaks,1,It's a rollercoaster of a lucid dream. I can't wait to see more.,Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8387,Twin Peaks,1,"So far Twin Peaks: The Return is jarring, disturbing, frustrating, fascinating, a little bit funny, and a lot weird. I hope we get to spend more time in Twin Peaks soon, but I'm in it for the full run.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8388,Twin Peaks,1,The Twin Peaks reboot is not the fusion of arthouse and mainstream sensibilities that viewers might expect. It's pure David Lynch -- and it's glorious.,Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8389,Twin Peaks,1,"Twin Peaks has become the show from another place, the darkness of future past, a geist that had to travel in time to find its zeit.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8390,Twin Peaks,1,"What seems clear is that Twin Peaks: The Return will rank as one of TV's most epic indulgences, so infatuated with its own fascinating and at times narcotizing weirdness that its value to the viewer will depend on their eagerness to ride along.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8391,Twin Peaks,1,"90s cult fave reboot just as odd, arresting as the original.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8392,Twin Peaks,1,"Twin Peaks: The Return jettisons the outdated premise of the white suburbs as a bastion of innocence. In fact, it leaves behind the series' namesake town for the bulk of the action -- and is much more compelling for it.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8393,Twin Peaks,1,Twin Peaks remains the nightmare fuel it always has been.,Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8394,Twin Peaks,1,Confounding but still vintage Lynch.,Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8395,Twin Peaks,0,Lynch's twisted brutalization of women likewise continues... It all seems to be part of the director's basic playbook. And it's past time for him to be called out on it.,Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8396,Twin Peaks,1,"Depending on your familiarity with David Lynch's body of work and your opinion of which, Twin Peaks' near-complete diversion from small town soap to full-fledged science-fiction horror will either come as a shock or natural progression.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8397,Twin Peaks,1,"This is next-level, full-tilt, mind-f**k TV.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8398,Twin Peaks,0,"Yes, it's weird. Yes, it's ""Lynchian."" But there's a lot more weirdness on TV than there was in 1990.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8399,Twin Peaks,1,"From the first twang of Angelo Badalamenti's haunting theme music, it was as if Lynch was determined to remind all those shows indebted to Twin Peaks -- True Detective and Fargo, for example -- that no one does weird quite like him.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8400,Twin Peaks,1,"You don't go to Lynch for coherence anyway. You watch his work because you want to experience his open-air id, his uncorked subconscious, working through a dream-logic that requires a viewer to let go and groove on whatever Lynch throws at you.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8401,Twin Peaks,1,"What premiered on Sunday was as accessibly scary, disturbing and audaciously funny as many of the best parts of the original Twin Peaks, and nowhere near as hallucinatory and subtextually distilled as the prequel film Fire Walk With Me.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8402,Twin Peaks,1,"It is deliberately, punishingly tedious -- but that's why Twin Peaks is so beguiling.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8403,Twin Peaks,1,"Twin Peaks: The Return was creepy, surreal, bizarre, and often unintelligible. Just like its predecessor.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8404,Twin Peaks,1,"Yes, the new Twin Peaks is weird, and feels like Lynch more unfiltered than ever, but it also very definitely has a narrative",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8405,Twin Peaks,0,"It's hard not to feel like I've been completely, utterly duped. The two-hour kickoff did not repair the damage wrought by Season 2. If anything, it was like taking a sip of damn fine coffee after learning that someone had stuck a fish in the pot.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8406,Twin Peaks,1,"It's amazing it was made at the time, and exciting to have it back now. May it make us all a little crazy.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8407,Twin Peaks,1,"As the return of Twin Peaks surges on after a promising but troubled start, I have to credit it with this: It's the rare screen entertainment that allows us to contemplate faces that have aged in real time.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8408,Twin Peaks,1,"Twin Peaks feels like the story of two Dale Coopers: one on the inside, one on the outside, all shrouded in a curtain of creepiness, theatrically, stilted acting and unnerving moments sandwiched in between.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8409,Twin Peaks,1,"Very little of this re-entry into ""Twin Peaks"" makes any sense. Yet it's admirable that the drama's creators have found a way to update the universe without relinquishing its signature atmosphere.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8410,Twin Peaks,1,It may the more grounded plot strand that speaks loudest both to newcomers to the acid trip known as Twin Peaks - and to me.,Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8411,Twin Peaks,1,"Things may be a little different but, twenty-five years later, Twin Peaks is still a place I want to be.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8412,Twin Peaks,1,"What does it all mean? Hell if I know. But that's the fundamental joy of Twin Peaks: The Return, whose odd tonal shifts, scarily schizoid imagery, and mind-boggling train-of-thought digressions are unadulterated Lynch.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8413,Twin Peaks,1,One question hanging over the revival was: would Twin Peaks still seem special now that so many shows have been born in its image? There are echoes of The Bridge and Stranger Things. But these are not so much borrowings as I'll-have-that-backs,Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8414,Twin Peaks,1,"Twenty-six years after the original left the air, Lynch is still more than capable of confounding and unsettling us.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8415,Twin Peaks,1,"Twin Peaks obsessives have been waiting for the box to come to life with Agent Cooper once again inside, and while we got our wish, we also got everything that comes along with the package deal that is David Lynch's surrealistic filmmaking.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8416,Twin Peaks,1,"This revival is fascinating, delirious and definitively, unmistakably Lynchian, but somewhere in the intervening years the state of mind that defined the original has been lost.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8417,Twin Peaks,1,The return of Twin Peaks would bewilder anyone unfamiliar with the show. But the visuals were still arresting.,Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8418,Twin Peaks,1,"As much as season 3 shows the advancement of Lynch's style, it still remains true to its traditions.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8419,Twin Peaks,1,"Twin Peaks must be treated now as it was then: a slow moving painting, detailed almost in real time, as the artist applies stroke after stroke to the canvas, a layered pile of movement, music and cryptic spoken words.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8420,Twin Peaks,1,"This is a completely new Twin Peaks, a show both aware of its cultural impact and its importance to fans, but also something that has completely evolved to embrace all the things that have changed in its world since it last aired.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8421,Twin Peaks,1,"The two-hour season premiere somehow managed to feel both familiar and strange, putting friendly faces in frightening new contexts, at once sweetly nostalgic and starkly sinister. It's a hell of a thing.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8422,Twin Peaks,1,"Lynch and Frost didn't bring back Twin Peaks to merely please themselves or flaunt their oddities. They brought it back as a piece of pure Sunday-night entertainment, and that may be the most surprising thing about it.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8423,Twin Peaks,0,"""I am dead. Yet I live,"" [Laura Palmer] said. Much the same could be said of the revival, which resembles a danse macabre, full of familiar steps, but with some new missteps all of its own.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8424,Twin Peaks,1,"Suffice it to say that if, by the end of these re-introductory two hours, you can follow what is happening, then you haven't been paying attention.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8425,Twin Peaks,1,"Twin Peaks was always about how it feels. And as funny and as shocking as this opener was, what we are really left with is sadness, much of it stemming from time itself -- past lives, present realities, age, death.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8426,Twin Peaks,1,"Beyond the cast, the show was beautifully shot by Peter Deming, and Angelo Badalamenti's score is as iconic as ever. The pieces of this puzzle inspire rapture. But when you try to assemble them, what kind of picture do you create?",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8427,Twin Peaks,1,"The first two hours should, at least, pique any fan's curiosity. And for a program that never fit in a neat little box, Lynch and company have seemingly found the right time and place to reappear.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8428,Twin Peaks,1,"Lynch likes to take his time and let the camera linger over waterfalls, red curtains and other elements of place that made the original series such a weird and wonderful ride.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8429,Twin Peaks,1,"Mr. Lynch's mastery of tension persists. The script, by him and Mr. Frost, recognizes the power of silence and anticipation. And Mr. Lynch, who is directing the entire revival, still has his penchant for dualities and eerie beauty.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8430,Twin Peaks,1,"Twin Peaks defies ultimate analysis, and ultimate judgment. That's its secret and mystique, and why it's back after 25 years, as a reminder that TV -- like art -- doesn't have to be reduced to nuts and bolts, or to specific meaning either.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8431,Twin Peaks,1,"For fans who have loved the show's surreal, subversive spirit, Lynch has supercharged every element that made the original series a TV classic.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8432,Twin Peaks,1,"It's bleak, uncompromising, and laced with the rumbling sense of dread and unease that makes Lynch such a formidable filmmaker.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8433,Twin Peaks,1,What a good show this is. Who cares who killed who?,Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8434,Twin Peaks,1,"Two hours of sumptuously photographed, obtuse, patience-taxing, and sometimes demonically horrifying imagery that I'll bet single-handedly destroyed the nostalgic goodwill that had accrued since the show was announced.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8435,Twin Peaks,0,"The show, which derived its power from the aftermath of trauma in a small community, has chosen to tell a story that's odder and bigger -- so big, in fact, that it has so far choked off what made Twin Peaks work all along.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8436,Twin Peaks,1,"I loved every plodding, baffling minute of it.",Paramount+,82%,89%,98
8437,Twin Peaks,1,Lynch's vision is so total and absolute that he can get away with what wouldn't be otherwise acceptable .,Paramount+,82%,89%,98

8443,Why Women Kill,1,"A frump becoming a society diva just seems like a thin storyline... Fortunately, Cherry once again knows how to cast his female leads. If there's anyone we'd want to watch blossom over the course of a season, it's the effervescent Tolman.",Paramount+,76%,91%,7
8444,Why Women Kill,1,"There's so much beauty in every frame, from the costumes to the production design - and actors able to rise to the occasion - that it's easy to ignore that the series isn't necessarily stretching itself.",Paramount+,76%,91%,7
8445,Why Women Kill,1,"Surpasses the first season by concentrating on one story and one set of interconnected characters, boosted by an excellent cast.",Paramount+,76%,91%,7
8446,The Legend of Korra,1,"Much of the frustration with Legend of Korra is warranted, particularly around the political narratives it's endorsing. At the same time, Korra denies us the easy solutions that leave us feeling cozy after watching Avatar.",Paramount+,89%,78%,10
8447,The Legend of Korra,1,"The martial-arts action segments are unparalleled (like an animated Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), but Korra's status as one of the great feminist cartoon heroines secures her place on this list.",Paramount+,89%,78%,10
8448,The Legend of Korra,1,"[Kuvira] is a fearsome beauty, possessing a strength and determination that could rival Amon, or even Zaheer. While her motivations for this new world order are still unclear, she should be an interesting addition to this season",Paramount+,89%,78%,10
8449,The Legend of Korra,1,"I loved this show by the end, and I can't tell you how happy it made me to see such a strong lineup of female characters, led by the strongest who was a woman of color.",Paramount+,89%,78%,10
8450,The Legend of Korra,1,Korra's growth from brash and impatient teenager to capable leader and mature woman is incredibly satisfying; Korra managed to be one of the best series about a female superhero since Buffy the Vampire Slayer.,Paramount+,89%,78%,10
8451,The Legend of Korra,1,In a cultural climate that is starving for strong female representation... -- The Legend Of Korra has consistently delivered captivating female figures.,Paramount+,89%,78%,10

8463,Teen Wolf,0,"This finale felt like more of a cliffhanger than anything the show has done before, which is a strange choice when writing the series finale. I don't love knowing that there's a huge war to be fought and that's where all these people are going.",Paramount+,81%,84%,12

8633,Freaks and Geeks,1,"The young actors are natural and convincing, and the high school characters manage to be funny without too much Dawson's Creek glibness.",Paramount+,100%,96%,32
8634,Freaks and Geeks,1,"Paul Feig have fashioned a dramatic comedy that perhaps gets it a tad too right. Freaks and Geeks carries a sheen of bleakness, of sadness and depression that strives to equate the lives of middle teens with those of infantrymen on the front lines.",Paramount+,100%,96%,32
8635,Freaks and Geeks,1,"Freaks and Geeks is that wonderful rarity among television series, a show that simultaneously lampoons reality and embraces it.",Paramount+,100%,96%,32
8636,Freaks and Geeks,1,"This show only produced 18 episodes, but it's been lauded and beloved for 16 years since its unceremonious axing.",Paramount+,100%,96%,32
8637,Freaks and Geeks,1,The show deals with situations that we can all relate to. It is a very rare thing to see a television show with such love for its characters and its world - a true gem.,Paramount+,100%,96%,32
8638,Freaks and Geeks,1,Mass audiences are only interested in reliving high school if it's sentimentalized. The chance to revisit something remotely in the ballpark of the real thing is as appetizing as cafeteria food-and Freaks and Geeks was a weekly feast of teen awkwardness.,Paramount+,100%,96%,32
8639,Freaks and Geeks,1,"Freaks and Geeks, despite its numerous flaws and hinting at Apatow's subsequent reliance on man-child humor in his feature films, often succeeds as humanist comedy precisely because the characters at its center are teenagers.",Paramount+,100%,96%,32
8640,Freaks and Geeks,1,"Freaks and Geeks distinguishes itself by the eerie realism of its portrayal of suburban high school life, circa 1980, from the ugly, boring clothes, to the across-the-board wonderful acting to the refreshing lack of narration.",Paramount+,100%,96%,32
8641,Freaks and Geeks,1,The most believable thing about this utterly believable show is that virtually every episode is made to pivot on an experience intrinsic to teenage life: embarrassment.,Paramount+,100%,96%,32
8642,Freaks and Geeks,1,"Watching the show often feels like an out-of-body experience, as if one were watching oneself navigate through high school. This is exactly what makes the show so timeless.",Paramount+,100%,96%,32
8643,Freaks and Geeks,1,"On the geeks' side, Martin Starr is simply brilliant as Bill, a lanky kid who's both bumblingly incoherent and strangely charismatic - words really can't do him justice, but suffice it to say he's one of the all-time great TV nerds, Screech be damned.",Paramount+,100%,96%,32
8644,Freaks and Geeks,1,"A series with the uninviting name Freaks and Geeks offers the most sensitive, touching and, yes, humorous look at the joys and pains of adolescence since The Wonder Years.",Paramount+,100%,96%,32
8645,Freaks and Geeks,1,"The humanism at Freaks And Geeks' heart lies entirely in its staunch, palpable belief that the smallest stories about marginalized figures not only deserve to be told, but have immeasurable worth.",Paramount+,100%,96%,32
8646,Freaks and Geeks,1,Freaks And Geeks works as well as it does because it's about fundamentally good people.,Paramount+,100%,96%,32
8647,Freaks and Geeks,1,"Freaks and Geeks boasts an extremely talented cast, evident by the fact that most of the members have gone on to notable careers in television and film.",Paramount+,100%,96%,32
8648,Freaks and Geeks,1,"This almost goes without saying, but in addition to being incredibly moving and relatable, Freaks and Geeks is extremely funny. No other show has captured the inherent humor of being an awkward teenager quite like this series did.",Paramount+,100%,96%,32
8649,Freaks and Geeks,1,"This may be the first TV show since Pee-wee's Playhouse to treasure youth even as it embodies all of its contradictions, craziness, hopes, and fears.",Paramount+,100%,96%,32
8650,Star Trek: Prodigy,1,It strikes a tone that will be unfamiliar to longtime fans. But it’s also good enough in its own right and worthy of the same leeway to accomplish what DS9 did so many years ago -- mark its own place within the Star Trek universe.,Paramount+,93%,73%,15
8651,Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"Star Trek: Prodigy is a rip-roaring adventure that will keep adults engaged, make kids think, and opens up endless possibilities for Star Trek more than any other series since the 1966 original.",Paramount+,93%,73%,15
8652,Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"There’s potential here, albeit of a moderate sort -- the character banter, with an ensemble featuring not just one but four different versions of comic relief, is passable, and John Noble could (and maybe is) do this kind of role in his sleep.",Paramount+,93%,73%,15
8653,Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"It's great to encourage younger audiences to boldly go themselves, but it also makes it difficult to pin the series' longevity and its utility beyond franchise newbies. Altogether, still an engaging and gorgeous series.",Paramount+,93%,73%,15
8654,Star Trek: Prodigy,1,Lost and Found is a necessary establishment of character and core story. Prodigy could well be a grower.,Paramount+,93%,73%,15
8655,Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"For those who have never heard of Starfleet, (and by extension, Star Trek) its a way to discover this world and its intentions of unity and moving forward as a collective than the individual. Its absolutely amazing!",Paramount+,93%,73%,15
8656,Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"But whatever Prodigy has planned with its game-changing engine, there's something quite beautiful about a show with so many connections back to Star Trek: Voyager...",Paramount+,93%,73%,15
8657,Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"Star Trek: Prodigy is a treat for the eyes, as the creators choose a completely digital animation style that makes each scene feel engaging and eye-catching.",Paramount+,93%,73%,15
8658,Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"the double-sized premiere of Prodigy seems to be entirely in its own lane, refreshingly unconcerned with previous Star Trek series until two minutes before the closing credits.",Paramount+,93%,73%,15
8659,Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"With its cinematic artistry, immersive score, and layered character development, this is NOT your parents' weekly prime time cartoon.",Paramount+,93%,73%,15
8660,Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"The new cast is fun with lots of appeal for younger viewers, and Ella Purnell's Gwyn and Rylee Alazraqui's Rok-Tahk are already stealing a lot of their scenes due to their nuanced and empathetic vocal work.",Paramount+,93%,73%,15
8661,Star Trek: Prodigy,1,It's a fun way to extend the franchise that gives the series' writers a lot of room to experiment.,Paramount+,93%,73%,15
8662,Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"Might make some parents smile... My 7-year-old son has already asked to re-watch the second episode of Prodigy so this latest ""Trek"" is certainly well-calibrated to capture the interest of its target audience.",Paramount+,93%,73%,15
8663,Star Trek: Prodigy,0,"The show mostly just transparently trades off the ""Trek"" title without feeling like it's going anywhere, boldly or otherwise.",Paramount+,93%,73%,15
8664,Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"A visually stunning, hope filled & unique story -- for new and old Star Trek fans alike!",Paramount+,93%,73%,15
8665,Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,"While on the surface it appears to be nostalgia-bait, closer inspection reveals that at the heart of Lower Decks pumps one the most earnest and well-told Trek series to date, propelled by great characters and its love but critique of the franchise.",Paramount+,83%,65%,11
8666,Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,But by balancing that lighthearted sense of nostalgia with a more serious engagement with the entire premise of Star Trek...Lower Decks season two continues to punch above its weight.,Paramount+,83%,65%,11
8667,Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,"There is no doubt - Season 2 is, overall, a stronger year of Lower Decks than Season 1.",Paramount+,83%,65%,11
8668,Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,Star Trek: Lower Decks has already done a fantastic job of really diving into the internal conflict and privileges of the typical Starfleet bridge crew and the tough lives our lower deckers live.,Paramount+,83%,65%,11
8669,Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,"It's always difficult to review a show without seeing the full season and knowing how the character and story arcs play out, but so far, Lower Decks season 2 remains a highly enjoyable way to ""engage"" with the Star Trek universe.",Paramount+,83%,65%,11
8670,Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,"Lower Decks has captured the essence of why so many people love Trek in general, that unique combination of likable characters, who are good people, doing ""sci-fi stuff."" In this way, ""Strange Energies"" is near perfect.",Paramount+,83%,65%,11
8671,Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,"A confident improvement on an already solid first season, Star Trek: Lower Decks Season 2 is a fun sci-fi romp for hardcore Trekkies and non-believers alike.",Paramount+,83%,65%,11
8672,Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,"The ability to bring in new elements and still keep the core in place is a key part of a strong Trek show, as the blending of the work-place drama and the anthology series is a large part of the franchise's continued drawing power.",Paramount+,83%,65%,11
8673,Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,"For as much as the general love for Trek permeates this show, Lower Decks really has begun to come into its own with its own characters and its own unique spin on what makes a story work in this particular vision for the 24th century.",Paramount+,83%,65%,11
8674,Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,"In season two, Lower Decks continues that balanced groove with even more confidence in mixing comedy with away mission hijinks and character progression.",Paramount+,83%,65%,11
8675,Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,The premiere hits us with the consequences of all this disruption on both the large and small scale.,Paramount+,83%,65%,11
8676,Frasier,1,"Final episodes of long-running series are almost impossible to craft, and this one had its flaws. The episode never found a comfortable rhythm, which left one feeling emotionally jangled from time to time.",Paramount+,95%,94%,7
8677,Frasier,1,"Deftly mixing genuine warmth with screwball farce in what became its hallmark, the series rolls out the big emotional guns while providing a small reminder of what brought it such acclaim through its 11-year run.",Paramount+,95%,94%,7
8678,Frasier,1,"The final episode itself had kind of a quiet dignity about it even with the screwball comedy involving Daphne's brothers. It was really great to see everyone on the show finally ""grow up"", Frasier in particular.",Paramount+,95%,94%,7
8679,Frasier,1,It seems right that the series end on a high note.,Paramount+,95%,94%,7
8680,Frasier,1,Comedy has moved on. We've moved on... But then last night was one of those flickers of happier times. Actually it was pretty damn good.,Paramount+,95%,94%,7
8681,Frasier,1,"Whenever it sticks closely with the Crane brothers, however, this likely final season of Frasier often ranks with some of the series' best work.",Paramount+,95%,94%,7
8682,Frasier,1,"The men of the Crane family have come the furthest in these 11 years; they love, support and--gasp!--respect each other. It's not surprising to realize that--11 years later--we do too.",Paramount+,95%,94%,7
8683,Nathan for You,1,"Do yourself a favor and watch Nathan For You: A Celebration, a hilarious look back on the first three seasons.",Paramount+,97%,95%,3
8684,Nathan for You,1,"""Celebration"" has a certain ""neither fish nor fowl"" quality to it that makes it occasionally frustrating. But it works as a full-length teaser for the upcoming season, and it goes far enough beyond that to work decently enough as a standalone episode.",Paramount+,97%,95%,3
8685,Nathan for You,1,"It's funny! Very, very, very funny.",Paramount+,97%,95%,3
8686,Scorpion,1,"If you were feeling at all nostalgic for Katharine McPhee's Smash days, [Season 4's] musical number must have been heaven... excluding Toby, Sylvester and Cabe's flamenco costumes, of course.",Paramount+,61%,77%,3
8687,Scorpion,1,What is going to make Scorpion super interesting this season is the balance between Paige and Walter now that there's an official relationship on the books.,Paramount+,61%,77%,3
8688,Scorpion,1,"If there was a show that could pull off a random musical intro, Scorpion is definitely it.",Paramount+,61%,77%,3
8689,Under the Dome,1,"We're left with the show revived once again, an Under The Dome redux, as this week's episode title puts it. And damn it if it hasn't succeeding in sparking my interest yet again.",Paramount+,68%,46%,10
8690,Under the Dome,0,"Under the Dome limped toward the finish, all right. But it's because the show shot itself in the foot.",Paramount+,68%,46%,10
8691,Under the Dome,0,There's a difference between a storyline and just writing a load of nonsense. Vote with your remote.,Paramount+,68%,46%,10
8692,Under the Dome,0,"If there was a destination or a point in mind, it's well past the point of mattering now.",Paramount+,68%,46%,10
8693,Under the Dome,1,The most relatable aspects of Under the Dome focus on the question of sustainability.,Paramount+,68%,46%,10
8694,Under the Dome,0,"The torturous double-feature of ""Move On"" and ""But I'm Not"" may as well have been in Swahili or Dome-anese because I haven't the foggiest about what actually happened in it. Are we even sure they showed the right episode?",Paramount+,68%,46%,10
8695,Under the Dome,1,"All things considered, this was a solid, if unspectacular return for the show.",Paramount+,68%,46%,10
8696,Under the Dome,1,"Under the Dome is certainly broadcast television's most enjoyable science-fiction/fantasy series, a summer treat that, while sometimes silly and over-the-top, is never less than energetically imaginative and aware of the history of its genre.",Paramount+,68%,46%,10
8697,Under the Dome,1,"As far as answers go, we may not have gotten the full monty, but an effort was made to drive us toward (hopefully) the endgame.",Paramount+,68%,46%,10
8698,Under the Dome,1,"This is all derivative, of course, cribbing from The Matrix and (as always) Lost, but this show is always more fun when it leans into its sci-fi elements.",Paramount+,68%,46%,10
8699,Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"Star Trek's first Black Captain, Benjamin Sisko, is an amazing character whose Blackness never feels dialed down.",Paramount+,91%,88%,13
8700,Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"By doing away with Gene Roddenberry's ridiculous utopian vision of the future (no poverty, no colds, no racial strife), DS9 had a much more realistic view of the human condition. And, unlike the other series, it rarely offered good-vs-evil plots.",Paramount+,91%,88%,13
8701,Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"Special effects during the extensive battle sequences, with fleets of starships attacking each other in outer space, are unprecedentedly complex for Star Trek.",Paramount+,91%,88%,13
8702,Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"It's an exciting and moving close to a series that still had so much life left in it. Major arcs are brought to an end and entirely new ones are begun, but the most important thing is that the show left on its own terms and in its own way",Paramount+,91%,88%,13
8703,Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"Deep Space 9 was Star Trek at its most artful and impactful. More than that, it was science fiction at its most incisive.",Paramount+,91%,88%,13
8704,Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,The best Star Trek is Deep Space Nine.,Paramount+,91%,88%,13
8705,Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"Simultaneously downbeat and optimistic in its refusal to bring the story to an end, there's something effortlessly fitting about the way that Trek's most challenging incarnation draws to a close.",Paramount+,91%,88%,13
8706,Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"Like the best of the Star Trek franchise, the show pushes viewers to consider the moral, ethical, and political questions surrounding foreign aid and nation-building.",Paramount+,91%,88%,13
8707,Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"A welcome change of pace from the horrors of season seven's war arc, this episode was a brave study of post-traumatic stress and its devastating repercussions for an endearing character.",Paramount+,91%,88%,13
8708,Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine is much better than The Next Generation and worthy your time. It is a surprisingly mature, complex, ambitious, and exciting Star Trek endeavor.",Paramount+,91%,88%,13
8709,Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,The season had something for everyone.,Paramount+,91%,88%,13
8710,Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"Deep Space Nine, for all its Prophets and visions and prophecy, was always more interested in the complicated ways that people fit together than it was in god fights and prophecy.",Paramount+,91%,88%,13
8711,Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"[It] gets more interesting and compelling with each succeeding year and it signed off at its peak: the final season doesn't lack for ambition and, apart from a TV budget that starves the visual sweep, it succeeds in meeting it with only minor caveats",Paramount+,91%,88%,13
8712,Everybody Hates Chris,1,"[It] was a family sitcom that both harkened back to the Norman Lear comedies of old, while still retaining the rapid pace and tight construction of the best single-camera productions.",Paramount+,95%,98%,6
8713,Everybody Hates Chris,1,"It was sharply written, very funny and didn't shy away from serious topics race and class, like so many feel-good nostalgic comedies [do].",Paramount+,95%,98%,6
8714,Everybody Hates Chris,1,"These are Chris' formative years, and although they're played for laughs, there's also poignancy to them.",Paramount+,95%,98%,6
8715,Everybody Hates Chris,1,The result is a funny show that shines a serious spotlight on race relations.,Paramount+,95%,98%,6
8716,Everybody Hates Chris,1,"[The] season finale of CW's Everybody Hates Chris, which ended with a fabulous nod to the finale of The Sopranos, did everything you could ask of a clever comedy.",Paramount+,95%,98%,6
8717,Everybody Hates Chris,1,This warmhearted series is a prime example of how to take serious issues and approach them in a humorous yet thought-provoking way.,Paramount+,95%,98%,6
8718,Interrogation,1,"Ambitious, non-linear true crime show is edgy, satisfying.",Paramount+,57%,87%,14
8719,Interrogation,1,It's well-acted with great dialogue and direct lending to some really great and compelling performances. The series is a well-executed yet innovative true-crime series that leaves you guessing.,Paramount+,57%,87%,14
8720,Interrogation,1,"Interrogation couldn't have properly existed a decade ago, and thus John Mankiewicz & Anders Weidemann deserve special credit for trying something new, especially under the CBS umbrella.",Paramount+,57%,87%,14
8721,Interrogation,1,"The crime drama lets you watch its middle eight episodes in any order, but it's more powerful as a straightforward story.",Paramount+,57%,87%,14
8722,Interrogation,0,Perhaps more frustrating is that some of our time in the '80s is given to us free of a person's recollection of events.,Paramount+,57%,87%,14
8723,Interrogation,0,"Ultimately, not unlike the case explored by the detectives, accused killers, and put-upon lawyers of Interrogation, the show doesn't necessarily prove what it's actively trying to prove (crime dramas are interesting if you can choose your own fate).",Paramount+,57%,87%,14
8724,Interrogation,1,"So, while I highly recommend Interrogation for the way the crime and its aftermath unfolds and the dedicated performances by its talented cast, I have to recommend that you watch in order.",Paramount+,57%,87%,14
8725,Interrogation,1,"The show can be a little overheated, especially toward the top, but at most moments, something interesting is going on on-screen, and there are some fine, subtle performances among a smattering of less subtle ones.",Paramount+,57%,87%,14
8726,Interrogation,0,We have no confidence that this mix-and-match episode format is anything more than a gimmick and will just lead to confused viewers.,Paramount+,57%,87%,14
8727,Interrogation,0,The most disappointing aspect of Interrogation may be the writers' reluctance to peddle uncertainty.,Paramount+,57%,87%,14
8728,Interrogation,1,"The deeper you dig, the more Interrogation becomes an unusually compelling tragedy of a family shattered by Mary's murder and Eric's conviction.",Paramount+,57%,87%,14
8729,Interrogation,0,The idea of a Choose Your Own Adventure approach to a crime procedural is certainly exciting on paper; it's a true disappointment that it doesn't work in execution.,Paramount+,57%,87%,14
8730,Interrogation,1,An interesting idea with an engaging enough story to be worth checking out.,Paramount+,57%,87%,14
8731,Interrogation,0,"Interrogation is just good enough to be frustrating for the ways in which it isn't yet better, and most of them stem back to the original sin of the show's format.",Paramount+,57%,87%,14
8732,Coyote,1,"Michael Chiklis gets his biggest role since The Shield in this impressive cross-border crime drama, and he tears into it with great gusto and versatility.",Paramount+,58%,82%,12
8733,Coyote,1,"The only surprise in Coyote is the quality: It's very good. Sometimes a noir, sometimes a Western, sometimes a tense action thriller and sometimes piquantly funny, Coyote has something for nearly everybody",Paramount+,58%,82%,12
8734,Coyote,1,"We'll give Coyote the benefit of the doubt, given the presence of both Chiklis and MacLaren.",Paramount+,58%,82%,12
8735,Coyote,1,"These final two episodes painted a more nuanced portrait of El Catrin, aka Juan Diego.",Paramount+,58%,82%,12
8736,Coyote,0,"An unwanted bouquet of loose ends gradually reveals itself - quite possibly the result of the season order being truncated from 10 to six episodes after a COVID work stoppage, but unfortunate and distracting nonetheless.",Paramount+,58%,82%,12
8737,Coyote,1,"Binge-bait, and compelling binge-bait at that.",Paramount+,58%,82%,12
8738,Coyote,1,"Coyote benefits by stronger plotting, an authentic sense of place and a more rounded portrayal of the crime family that traps Ben in their internal power struggle.",Paramount+,58%,82%,12
8739,Coyote,0,"""Coyote"" may find its way to more substance if it's allowed to prowl a bit longer, but like Ben's bowel movements, you're just as likely to be relieved that it's over.",Paramount+,58%,82%,12
8740,Coyote,0,To be blunt: a show that asks its audience to connect to a rogue Border Patrol agent with literal blood on his hands needs to work harder than this one does to justify its premise.,Paramount+,58%,82%,12
8741,Coyote,0,Assembled from spare parts left over from previous television trends and decaying prejudices.,Paramount+,58%,82%,12
8742,Coyote,0,"Breaking Bad director Michelle MacLaren gives this series a ""Bad"" vibe, but that doesn't insure it is good... Coyote proves watchable but too derivative.",Paramount+,58%,82%,12
8743,Coyote,1,"MacLaren shows her skills with pacing and visual language in the first pair of episodes, making the questionable plotting and dialogue easy to take.",Paramount+,58%,82%,12

8745,Star Trek: Enterprise,0,A sorry end to a landmark franchise.,Paramount+,55%,78%,5
8746,Star Trek: Enterprise,1,"Season Four is, by far, the strongest of Enterprise's seasons with so many great arcs. Enterprise was mothballed way too early.",Paramount+,55%,78%,5
8747,Star Trek: Enterprise,1,Coto and crew managed to finally deliver the goods that B&B were fatally unable to: old-fashioned Star Trek action and adventure.,Paramount+,55%,78%,5
8748,Star Trek: Enterprise,0,The most infuriating thing about Enterprise is the fact that it has always had some of the most potential of any of the Trek series and has always gone out of its way to squander every opportunity it has ever had to capitalize on that potential.,Paramount+,55%,78%,5
8749,Star Trek,1,"The point that I may be beating into the ground is that if you are willing to accept that the story is more important than the props, then you may find something to appreciate in the original ""Star Trek.""",Paramount+,80%,89%,10
8750,Star Trek,0,The less said about the reduced-budget third season the better.,Paramount+,80%,89%,10
8751,Star Trek,0,"Season one changed the genre as we know it, and the second season equally so; it's just a crying shame that the third couldn't have made it a hat trick.",Paramount+,80%,89%,10
8752,Star Trek,1,"Without recourse to expensive effects or sets, episodes like The Empath are essentially theatrical, and some scenes are surprisingly intense.",Paramount+,80%,89%,10
8753,Star Trek,0,"The actors seem tired, bored in most scenes. Even [William] Shatner, which is saying something.",Paramount+,80%,89%,10
8754,Star Trek,0,"It's just an unlikely space opera, overlong, clunkily put together and not the slightest bit amusing.",Paramount+,80%,89%,10
8755,Star Trek,1,"And perhaps Star Trek's most enduring achievement was to change the way we think about TV. Before Kirk went into space, shows were loved but disposable.",Paramount+,80%,89%,10
8756,Star Trek,1,"And most significant of all, he wrote complex, multilayered morality tales: stories set in the 23rd century, but with striking parallels for those in the 20th. His achievements can hardly be overstated.",Paramount+,80%,89%,10
8757,Star Trek,0,Talk about going out on a sour note.,Paramount+,80%,89%,10
8758,Star Trek,1,The most convincing argument one can give in favour of Season 3 is that even a bad season of Star Trek is worth watching.,Paramount+,80%,89%,10
8759,Cheers,1,"It Is a dark, suitably melancholy atmosphere as the bar becomes a sight for sore eyes, a place that Is no longer a refuge.",Paramount+,87%,93%,16
8760,Cheers,1,"As Cheers writers had done so often over the course of 275 episodes, the Charles brothers danced up to the edge of easy sentiment, then spun away with a wink.",Paramount+,87%,93%,16
8761,Cheers,1,After all the hype... it would be a miracle if the last episode of Cheers could still move you. But then Cheers has always been at least a minor miracle. Thursday night's final episode of the 11-year-old NBC sitcom was a 98-minute masterpiece.,Paramount+,87%,93%,16
8762,Cheers,1,"Cheers went out the way it came in: with grace, good humor and, above all, class.",Paramount+,87%,93%,16
8763,Cheers,1,"Although punchy and poignant, the show didn't -- couldn't -- live up to the firestorm of hype that preceded the episode. No show couldn't.",Paramount+,87%,93%,16
8764,Cheers,1,"It was too long, too much of it was devoted to the worn-out romantic teasing between Sam and Diane and the final musings dragged on a bit. But it was still the best thing on television Thursday night, as it has been for a longtime.",Paramount+,87%,93%,16
8765,Cheers,0,We waited 11 years for this? Last night's finale kept tantalizing us with possibilities that never quite materialized.,Paramount+,87%,93%,16

8786,Waco,0,"Waco has done far more ironing out than enriching in the episodes leading up to next week's grand finale. The Dowdles have hamstrung their own ambitions, reducing Waco from a reckoning with the muddled past to an oversimplification of it.",Paramount+,70%,75%,46
8787,Waco,1,"All of this is interesting, to be sure, but the most fascinating aspect of this story is Koresh's rise as a cult leader, the events that led so many people to abandon their lives and possessions to be in his presence was what happened before the siege.",Paramount+,70%,75%,46

8807,Waco,1,"Kitsch is quite convincing as Koresh. He plays Koresh as genuine, if not saintly, and that laconic Tim Riggins charisma is put to good use, or icky use if you keep waiting for the miniseries to find anything Koresh does problematic.",Paramount+,70%,75%,46
8808,Waco,1,"Waco is thought-provoking, risky, and engaging, with the type of nuanced performances that should garner Emmy nominations.",Paramount+,70%,75%,46

8812,Waco,1,The key choice here was the casting of Mr. Kitsch... who radiates sincerity and has an overflowing charisma that the real-life Koresh is said to have lacked.,Paramount+,70%,75%,46
8813,Waco,1,"Though it's difficult to say whether or not the 1993 Waco siege warrants revisiting, the Paramount Network's new six-part miniseries does the best job of examining such a loaded question.",Paramount+,70%,75%,46
8814,Waco,0,"Waco won't be the first drama to reduce a tragedy to its simplest components, but this doesn't offer much confidence that these are the right components or the only ones.",Paramount+,70%,75%,46
8815,Waco,0,"Despite a partially successful attempt to set the record straight, Waco too rarely offers the kind of depth that would make the examination of these powerful motivations compelling.",Paramount+,70%,75%,46

8819,Waco,1,"Don't expect ""Waco"" to break out as one of 2018's stealth critical successes or award magnets. Still and all, it is adequate television - succinct and informative enough to at least glance at sideways.",Paramount+,70%,75%,46

8965,Chappelle's Show,0,Comedy Central made a huge mistake in airing unfinished (and mediocre) skits left behind when Chappelle bailed on the network two years ago. That's not to say I can't understand its motivation.,Paramount+,96%,100%,16
8966,Chappelle's Show,1,"The Lost Episodes isn't an exercise in barrel scraping, fortunately, but it would be a lot easier to enjoy this raw, personal material without twinges of guilt if this were a lovingly assembled bootleg rather than a corporate bid to recoup an investment.",Paramount+,96%,100%,16

8968,Chappelle's Show,1,"As three episodes of Chappelle's Show, ""The Lost Episodes"" don't measure up. As three episodes that depict how difficult it is to sustain something with its power, potency, ferocity, and intelligence, ""The Lost Episodes"" are essential.",Paramount+,96%,100%,16

8974,Guilty Party,1,"This series leans toward the funny end of the spectrum of the ""amateur detective who gets in over their head"" premise, but it also tends to use that comedy to cover up the shakier aspects of the writing.",Paramount+,40%,53%,10

8982,Guilty Party,0,"While a 30-minute dramatic series is often welcome, ""Guilty Party"" might have been better suited to a one-hour format that would allow Addelman and her team to flesh out the characters and their motivations as well as fine tune the tone.",Paramount+,40%,53%,10

8986,Detroiters,1,"Detroiters so easily could've been an insular half hour of bro-ey inside jokes, or worse, a Portlandia for the Motor City. Instead, it's a colorful world of dippy, hysterical characters that you want to spend time with. It's joy-inducing stuff.",Paramount+,94%,87%,10

8994,Inside Amy Schumer,1,It's not clear if Season 4's relative mildness is a result of Schumer's split focus...but Amy still packs in plenty of solid laughs.,Paramount+,86%,51%,14
8995,Inside Amy Schumer,0,"For Inside Amy Schumer to bounce back, it perhaps needs to veer away from her newfound superstardom and back toward the blunt, abrasive honesty that made her a success to begin with.",Paramount+,86%,51%,14
8996,Inside Amy Schumer,1,"Between seasons 3 and 4, Schumer became a bonafide movie star, but instead of treating ""Inside"" like a day job, she's continuing to use it as a platform. Sometimes she strikes out, but she's still got a hell of a swing.",Paramount+,86%,51%,14
8997,Inside Amy Schumer,1,"Schumer's dark, violent sketches make us laugh even as they pack a much-needed gut punch. This isn't to say the current season of Inside Amy Schumer isn't funny. She adeptly and hilariously spoofs broad pop culture genres.",Paramount+,86%,51%,14
8998,Inside Amy Schumer,1,Inside Amy Schumer upped the level of naughty sketch comedy last season and seemingly keeps up the pace as season four starts.,Paramount+,86%,51%,14

9003,Inside Amy Schumer,1,The comedian's back to basics (albeit now with a few celebrity friends) by making the same kind of sketches that made her famous and crafting a few viral hits along the way.,Paramount+,86%,51%,14
9004,Inside Amy Schumer,1,"Still funny without being revelatory, the new season may represent a crossroads of sorts for Schumer: Can the former underdog strike the same rich comedic veins now that she's a star?",Paramount+,86%,51%,14
9005,Inside Amy Schumer,0,"There are jokes about what it means to be an everyday woman, but they're sprinkled in among jokes about what it must be like to be Amy Schumer, and it messes with the voice of the show.",Paramount+,86%,51%,14
9006,Inside Amy Schumer,1,They're all funny and - even better than that - smart. Fans will be pleased. The hotness will only grow hotter.,Paramount+,86%,51%,14

9038,Yellowjackets,1,"The larger Yellowjackets discussion isn’t just about the parasocial adoption of others’ trauma, but the way we talk about the girls and the show and regress into a deliriously unhinged version of the ’90s that I didn’t even know I wanted, and it rules.",Prime Video,100%,78%,73

9226,Barry,1,"Barry is simply a masterpiece of deeply humane, hilarious satire.",Prime Video,99%,89%,51
9227,Barry,1,"In Season 3, the comic drama gets as dark and morally knotty as Better Call Saul. Like Bob Odenkirk’s Saul, Hader’s Barry proves that an SNL funnyman can turn out to be one of the great dramatic actors on TV.",Prime Video,99%,89%,51
9228,Barry,1,"Season 3 goes darker than this show every has before as it is unafraid to deep dive into PTSD, abuse, violence, humanity, and forgiveness. Filled with incredibly powerful performances by all involved, this is the best season yet.",Prime Video,99%,89%,51
9229,Barry,1,"Among the many gifts Bill Hader delivers in this fabulous new chapter of his series is that, in picking off almost exactly where he left us, it feels almost as if the last two years never happened. How great is that?",Prime Video,99%,89%,51
9230,Barry,1,"Still strange, dark, harrowing and often — unexpectedly — very funny.",Prime Video,99%,89%,51

9455,Succession,1,"Success hasn't spoiled Succession, as the Emmy-winning drama returns with all its Shakespearean and Murdochian overtones intact, with a bruising father-son battle over its fictional media empire. Stripped of that, the HBO series remains enormously fun.",Prime Video,94%,85%,93
9456,Succession,1,"Two years was a long wait, but the payoff is glorious.",Prime Video,94%,85%,93
9457,Succession,1,"Maybe it's churlish to complain about a series that's still consistently better written and more refreshingly caustic than anything else on TV. But for me, Season Three reveals some wear in a concept that once felt rousingly original.",Prime Video,94%,85%,93

9460,Succession,1,"Propelled by the best ensemble cast you'll find anywhere-Nicholas Braun and Matthew Macfadyen are a dream team of lacerating laughs- Season 3 is the funniest, fiercest 'Succession' yet. It's a perverse pleasure to ogle the rich abusing their privileges.",Prime Video,94%,85%,93

9464,Succession,1,"It is a visceral pleasure to see Succession again. And its distinctive methods are intact: The seething jealousies and back-stabbing that unfold when the family unites; the flinty, often ferocious dialogue full of swearing and barking aggression.",Prime Video,94%,85%,93
9465,Succession,1,"There are more laughs to be had watching Succession than most TV comedies, a testament to the show's writers who imbue the Roy children with specific foibles and a general lack of self-awareness.",Prime Video,94%,85%,93
9466,Succession,1,"Every part of Succession shimmers. Armstrong's scripts are top-notch, brought to life by cinematographer Andrij Parekh, production designer Stephen Carter and director Mark Mylod, and set magnificently to Nicholas Britell's score.",Prime Video,94%,85%,93

9481,Succession,1,"When they're throwing the most lavish and unbearable parties imaginable, Succession clicks. But every second we're talking directly about politics is a second we aren't making fun of Kendall for forgetting about his children.",Prime Video,94%,85%,93
9482,Succession,1,"So far, at any rate, Succession's latest season is certainly off the hook - a real good job do-er, full of little Machiavellian f***s, and funny enough to leave viewers laughing as if they grew up on a hyena farm.",Prime Video,94%,85%,93
9483,Succession,1,"Being a Roy is such a lonely endeavor, none of the members from this family can trust their relatives. The show makes you ponder: How much is too much money? At what point in financial stability do you stop being at ease and start becoming a prick?",Prime Video,94%,85%,93

9487,Succession,1,"The idea that Kendall, Shiv, Roman, and Connor are just damaged kids play-acting at adulthood is even more prominent this season, as the four siblings try to haggle, argue, and dissemble their way to common ground.",Prime Video,94%,85%,93
9488,Succession,1,"Succession started out telling a story about the Roy family fracturing before showing those bonds start to mend. This season, the bonds that tie these characters together are ripped to shreds and we get a front row seat to the show.",Prime Video,94%,85%,93

9495,The Sopranos,1,"The Sopranos came up with an ending just as murky and disorienting as the 85 hours that led up to it. Rather than betray its ethos by bowing to convention, The Sopranos went out on its own terms.",Prime Video,92%,97%,31
9496,The Sopranos,1,"Who knows? We'll never know. And it's better that way. If you're thinking there's a movie in the works, think again. It was supposed to end like this.",Prime Video,92%,97%,31
9497,The Sopranos,1,"Any explanation... no matter how smart or well-reasoned, misses the point. To explain it would diminish it.",Prime Video,92%,97%,31

9499,The Sopranos,1,"Chase isn't the only auteur to turn an audience's bloodlust against itself, but unlike, say, Michael Haneke or Quentin Tarantino, he chose an unnervingly quiet way to leave us on the hook, in perpetuity.",Prime Video,92%,97%,31
9500,The Sopranos,1,It's still a master-class in building tension. David Chase mines more suspense out of a family talking at a diner as a young woman struggles to parallel park than most pure horror directors could even dream.,Prime Video,92%,97%,31
9501,The Sopranos,0,"To me, it felt like an hourlong f--- you from a guy who has seen fan devotion for The Sopranos transform him from a little-known but well respected TV producer into one of the most legendary TV auteurs in history.",Prime Video,92%,97%,31

9505,The Sopranos,1,Chase played us like a grand piano.,Prime Video,92%,97%,31
9506,The Sopranos,1,"It felt more violent, more disturbing, more unfair than even the most savage murders Chase has depicted over the course of six seasons, because the victim was us. He ended the series by whacking the viewer.",Prime Video,92%,97%,31
9507,The Sopranos,1,"Its final season mostly crackled, with the usual superior performances and writing from actors James Gandolfini and Edie Falco, and creator David Chase... For now it's curtains on an extraordinary achievement.",Prime Video,92%,97%,31
9508,The Sopranos,0,"David Chase, after so much brilliant work... seemed to be saying he could take it or leave it. So he left it.",Prime Video,92%,97%,31

9511,The Sopranos,1,"Chase had a grand time in his almost playful home stretch, offering a clue-strewn valedictory episode and a beautifully unresolved stopping point.",Prime Video,92%,97%,31
9512,The Sopranos,1,"Somehow, though, it feels like the perfect final note. Why wouldn't a show that's taken such pleasure in rewriting the rules of storytelling go out in the least conventional way possible?",Prime Video,92%,97%,31
9513,The Sopranos,1,"All of the death foreshadowing the author finds throughout the series is present, and it steps up a notch in the final season.",Prime Video,92%,97%,31

9516,The Sopranos,0,One can understand David Chase's desire to have a completely unique ending... But that doesn't mean we have to like it.,Prime Video,92%,97%,31

9522,The Sopranos,1,It may have been the greatest double-take -- by the audience -- in the history of American television.,Prime Video,92%,97%,31
9523,The Sopranos,1,"Each of the final episodes was anticipated not so much with pleasure as dread, since each posed the risk of an unacceptable loss, as characters in whom we had invested years of attention were swept away.",Prime Video,92%,97%,31
9524,The Wire,1,[Michael K.] Williams quietly dismantled preconceptions about masculinity and sexuality alike and became a hero and icon both on and off-screen. It's not his only great acting role.,Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9525,The Wire,1,"The Wire wasn't afraid to be gentle while laying out a bleaker truth for its viewers, delivering one of the more satisfying finales in television history.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9526,The Wire,1,It's far more satisfying than the dismal end to The Sopranos and it is noticeable that there is nothing that would prevent HBO from making another season of The Wire.,Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9527,The Wire,1,"Even if you came to series five cold, from a Wireless world, you'd have found plenty to enjoy: the way the dialogue is at once naturalistic and aphor-istic [and] the outstanding naturalism of the performances.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9528,The Wire,1,"Quite simply, it was the best television drama ever made, and if it's ever surpassed it won't be on this side of the Atlantic. British TV does not have the resources, the scriptwriters or the actors even to attempt something on this scale.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9529,The Wire,1,"The Wire amazes with its gritty attention to detail. It feels so damned real, and from Day One that's been both its blessing and its curse. You don't kick up your feet to watch. Nor do you feel at ease.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9530,The Wire,1,"The Wire is a programme that demands your full attention but eventually it repays you, and once it begins to weave its spell you'll find yourself, much like several of its characters, totally hooked and desperate for more.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9531,The Wire,1,"The Wire isn't the most accessible series. The show lays out a lot of plot strands, forcing the question: Where are we headed? Stick with it, though, and you'll see a remarkable tapestry.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9532,The Wire,1,"So much happened. At times it seemed too rushed, but ultimately it all came together as plots were hatched, schemes crumbled and truth and honesty took a major beating.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9533,The Wire,1,"The plots are labyrinthine and defy easy entry. The dialogue resonates with the lingua franca of the streets, so there's much that can't be accessed until viewers get used to the language.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9534,The Wire,1,The Wire avoids caricatures with pitch-perfect depictions of the criminals scrapping their way to the top of a bloody heap.,Prime Video,94%,97%,44

9536,The Wire,1,"This season, series creator David Simon has added an extra layer of interest by focusing on his newspaper roots. This season also is less complicated than past seasons.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9537,The Wire,1,"It's a tale less of crime and punishment than crime and survival... It all adds up to a message that requires a very precise rhythm, in script and performance, and from the first moments of this new season, The Wire is locked in.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9538,The Wire,1,"Led by a solid core of returning characters -- none true villains, none true heroes -- with important additions (and sad subtractions) each season, it's one of the best series of all time.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44

9541,The Wire,0,"Season 5's mistakes-clunky plotting, false parallels, confused motivations-are violations of the realism the show promised.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44

9545,The Wire,0,"Though interesting at times, the fictionalized account of The Baltimore Sun lacks the depth of the institutions depicted in seasons past.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44

9548,The Wire,1,"Creating a microcosm of a broken nation, The Wire remained, to the very last fade-out montage, as messy and often painful as life itself.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9549,The Wire,1,Among the many things that separate The Wire from other TV dramas is the way that creator David Simon eases into a season.,Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9550,The Wire,1,This episode quickly reminds us of how completely believable and engrossing the world Simon has created is. Every moment feels genuine.,Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9551,The Wire,1,"The dense mythology of HBO's The Wire, painstakingly created over five novelistic seasons, has enough drama packed inside to be easily spun out for the next five, ten, 15 years.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9552,The Wire,1,The show will go out as one of the medium's greatest.,Prime Video,94%,97%,44

9554,The Wire,1,"Some of the themes in The Wire may be generic (underpaid cops, newsroom politics), but the series achieves immense success in one vital regard for drama -- the feeling that we are in a real place.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9555,The Wire,1,"Based on the seven episodes previewed, it's every bit as cynical, riveting and brilliant as the four flights that preceded it -- a searing look at the decay of a major American city that puts most of what's on television to shame.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9556,The Wire,1,"It is as if, in a guilty fever, we dreamt up our own worst punishments-stories of the sort Joan Didion used to tell us about the princess caged in the consulate and the man with the candy leading the children into the sea.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9557,The Wire,1,"It is one of the most intimate and alarming depictions of urban America on television, and yet it's an invigorating and even exhilarating experience, each season a new Harry Potter book for adults.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9558,The Wire,1,The Wire certainly is Dickensian.,Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9559,The Wire,1,"The fifth and final season may be the most overtly farcical, but only because things in this slightly fictionalized Baltimore have become, if you can imagine, worse than ever. When the going gets tough on The Wire, the tough get funny.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9560,The Wire,1,Simon can rest assured that he's created something unique that will last well beyond the confines of its prime time ratings prison.,Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9561,The Wire,1,"If there's one problem with The Wire, it's that, five seasons in, too many beautifully realized characters fight for too little room - a gem of a complaint to have.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9562,The Wire,1,David Simon's sprawling epic of urban decay is as good as this startlingly brilliant show has ever been - and it has always been among TV's best.,Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9563,The Wire,1,"Not exactly a Hallmark card, but one hell of an artistic achievement.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9564,The Wire,1,Fans of the show will not likely be disappointed. This new 10-episode season boasts the same high quality of production that this series has always exhibited.,Prime Video,94%,97%,44

9566,The Wire,1,"Once again, Simon does the impossible. He takes themes we've heard a million times - our politicians are corrupt, our schools are failing our kids, our newspapers are being raped by corporate overlords - and he gracefully, subtly realizes them onscreen.",Prime Video,94%,97%,44
9567,The Wire,0,Simon so forces events in the improbable newspaper story line of an invented serial killer that he does serious damage to the credibility of the police drama.,Prime Video,94%,97%,44

9598,True Detective,1,"Exploring the grim certainty of battling time, Ali carries the show by subtly pushing against expectations, finding empathy in the murkiest darkness that True Detective has ever explored.",Prime Video,78%,74%,91
9599,True Detective,0,"The towering talent of Ali almost straightens out the third season of True Detective from its ultimately dull centrifugal swirl. Yet,[it's] is overwhelmed by... capricious leaps in time and thinly spread philosophical space",Prime Video,78%,74%,91

9611,True Detective,0,"Yet again ""True Detective,"" after a drawn-out hiatus, capitalizes heavily on atmosphere, artistry and the celebrity aura of its star players, at times focusing more emphatically on this garb than the integrity of its narrative skeleton.",Prime Video,78%,74%,91

9613,True Detective,0,True Detective falls prey to a slightly milder case of misogyny than afflicted it in season one.,Prime Video,78%,74%,91
9614,True Detective,1,What made True Detective special was the haze of strangeness that hung about it like a supernatural mist. Let us join hands and mouth a ritualistic prayer in the hope that TD3 is every bit as weird and quietly deranged.,Prime Video,78%,74%,91
9615,True Detective,0,"It is neither as raw and gripping as the series' rookie season nor as structurally unsound as its second. It is good, not great.",Prime Video,78%,74%,91
9616,True Detective,1,"What truly makes this chapter stand out is its willingness is take a step back to revel in what makes these characters - specifically Ali's - tick. It's not only a haunting mystery, but also a look at one man's struggle to find meaning in himself.",Prime Video,78%,74%,91

9629,True Detective,1,This is a script determinedly dedicated to the slow reveal. But it is also one alive with passion and a mordant wit.,Prime Video,78%,74%,91
9630,True Detective,1,"Despite the shadowy distractions, ""True Detective"" is a solid procedural led by a faceted leading performance.",Prime Video,78%,74%,91
9631,True Detective,1,"What elevates it are the brooding atmosphere and Ali's magnetic performance, from his dogged pursuit of the facts in his younger days to his convincing vulnerability in his elderly ones.",Prime Video,78%,74%,91
9632,True Detective,0,"What ultimately sinks this season is the dull sameness of it all... nearly every scene has the same rhythm and pacing, often centered on two or three people conferring solemnly in hushed voices; the show could be titled Men Mumbling About Crimes.",Prime Video,78%,74%,91
9633,True Detective,1,"Three seasons in, it's clear what ""True Detective"" is: a platinum-cast anthology of moody crime stories in which familiar cops with familiar demons chase familiar devils.",Prime Video,78%,74%,91

9636,True Detective,0,"It's clear that Pizzolotto still thinks like a novelist... His show struggles to find its sweet spot as a work of television, maybe because it's conceived with a pace and style that is better suited to the page.",Prime Video,78%,74%,91
9637,True Detective,1,These efforts pay off in a solid third season whose structure and style hew close to those of the first.,Prime Video,78%,74%,91

9643,True Detective,1,"Ali is breathtaking, giving us a trifecta of performances that grow increasingly complex with each passing decade.",Prime Video,78%,74%,91

9649,True Detective,1,This is addictive television.,Prime Video,78%,74%,91
9650,True Detective,0,This season's attempt to bring back the old True Detective magic also feels a bit stale.,Prime Video,78%,74%,91
9651,True Detective,1,"Where season three most improves upon the seasons preceding it, though, is in how it crystallizes something True Detective has always been about.",Prime Video,78%,74%,91
9652,True Detective,1,"It's just a well-made, well-acted, intelligently plotted, thematically rich mystery show. In 2019, that's both plenty and not enough.",Prime Video,78%,74%,91
9653,True Detective,1,"Tightly directed... and plotted, and with a performance at its center that steers away from calling attention to itself, the new ""True Detective"" transcends hype and amounts to 2019's first pleasant small-screen surprise.",Prime Video,78%,74%,91
9654,True Detective,1,"The premiere episodes show a lot of promise plotwise, teasing out a season that gets to the uniquely spooky roots that hooked audiences in the first go-round. If the devil really has come to Arkansas, we're happy to fall under his spell.",Prime Video,78%,74%,91
9655,True Detective,1,What sets this season of True Detective apart from either of the previous runs is that the crime here is not merely being investigated as much as it is being unraveled.,Prime Video,78%,74%,91
9656,True Detective,1,"At the very least, the new True Detective season is a three-tiered showcase for Mahershala Ali, who stays consistently mesmerizing even if the mystery around him does not.",Prime Video,78%,74%,91
9657,True Detective,1,"The show is good again and a near perfect copy of the show's creative height. The thing is, what we want out of our television shows has changed quite a bit in five years.",Prime Video,78%,74%,91

9665,Doom Patrol,1,Doom Patrol has learned the lesson that pathos not need require a morose tone. The show is at its finest when these flawed and funny people are allowed to be uproarious even when they're in pain.,Prime Video,97%,75%,10
9666,Doom Patrol,1,"Season 3 continues this trend, with hilariously weird moments seamlessly giving way to internalized therapy sessions you can't find anywhere else in the genre.",Prime Video,97%,75%,10

9678,Banshee,1,"While we expect shows to make bold moves as they near the conclusion, Banshee's shift as displayed here took some legitimate gumption.",Prime Video,90%,90%,11
9679,Banshee,1,"Banshee's story is full of twists and unexpected connections, as well as its telltale brutal violence. In a sick streak of creativity, the show continues to find new, gruesome ways to kill people.",Prime Video,90%,90%,11
9680,Superman & Lois,1,"Season 2 remains engaging thanks to its teenage relationships and family melodrama, courtesy of Clark Kents’ civilian neighbors, the Cushings. Perhaps without meaning to, the series becomes about the ripple effects of living in a world of superheroes.",Prime Video,86%,82%,3

9715,The Leftovers,1,"Between the prospect of a definitive ending, the looming fear of catastrophe, and the continually exceptional performances, it's bravura television that somehow follows the model of earlier seasons while subverting expectations.",Prime Video,91%,90%,46
9716,The Leftovers,1,"As a barely watched and short-lived HBO drama, The Leftovers doesn't have anyone or anything to answer for. But if these final episodes are any indication, more shows should have that luxury and that freedom.",Prime Video,91%,90%,46

9808,Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"""The Clone Wars"" kicked off its last season with a war-filled episode that will certainly have fans talking... But the episode tells all ""Star Wars"" fans that it's time to unite one more time and get through the ongoing battle together.",Prime Video,93%,92%,24

9811,Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"This is one of the biggest contributions that The Clone Wars brings to the Star Wars franchise. While the series rehabilitates the weaker parts in the Prequel trilogy, it breaks away from the light-vs.-dark dichotomy that defines the franchise.",Prime Video,93%,92%,24
9812,Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"The animation is better than ever, the spirit of the series-a more character-based version of the stories told between ""Attack Of The Clones"" and ""Revenge Of The Sith"" are as compelling as ever.",Prime Video,93%,92%,24
9813,Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"It's the brief breath of air that keeps the audience invested in the fates of the soldiers on screen, building up their characters by showing who they are when they aren't fighting for their lives.",Prime Video,93%,92%,24
9814,Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"I'm so happy to be writing these words: The Clone Wars is back baby, and it's good! But don't you think for a second that I didn't notice Anakin's longer hair, which is both beautiful and worrisome...",Prime Video,93%,92%,24

9821,Star Wars Rebels,1,"If you haven't seen Star Wars Rebels, you're gonna want to catch up. Much like The Clone Wars, it's got some of the strongest and most creative storytelling in the Star Wars franchise, but gets unfairly ignored by virtue of being an animated series.",Prime Video,98%,83%,10

9949,The Boys,1,"This season is chaotic, unhinged, and shocking. Antony Starr is on another level, as Homelander continues down his rage-filled path. The addition of Jenson Ackles as Soldier Boy is perfect, and this series continues to perfectly balance humor with action.",Prime Video,93%,85%,77
9950,The Boys,1,"The Boys Season 3 isn’t quite as shockingly powerful as Season 2 — there’s no topping Stormfront, apparently — but what the show lacks in political satire it makes up for with nuanced character development.",Prime Video,93%,85%,77
9951,The Boys,1,"S3 isn’t afraid to take things too far, and aims to make fans uncomfortable yet thoroughly entertained. The balance of seriousness, violence, humor, sex, grotesque, loving moments, and completely new elements–is a hit",Prime Video,93%,85%,77
9952,The Boys,1,Thanks to the final 2 episodes - which are very strong - Season 3 is definitely worth your time. But the first 5 episodes are very unfocused. Great storylines for the female characters. But Antony Starr is once again what really makes this show shine.,Prime Video,93%,85%,77

9964,The Boys,1,"The Boys Season 3 is taking it up a notch, in a way that feels almost too much at times and not nearly enough at others. In other words, The Boys Season 3 is very much The Boys and the show isn’t making any apologies for it, not that it has before.",Prime Video,93%,85%,77

9979,The Old Man,1,"It’s a simple cat-and-mouse premise, and the motivations are almost beside the point. The Old Man is less about the twists and turns of the spy genre and more of a showcase for Bridges and Lithgow, who are as good as they always are.",Prime Video,94%,86%,34

10466,Rise,1,"In a sense, the show itself is a rumination on whether a song would be enough to bridge any number of American divides. Part of the appeal of Rise is that it sure would be nice to think so.",Prime Video,59%,76%,41
10467,Rise,1,What Rise has going for it is an honesty that prevents it from falling into the traps in which Glee frequently became stuck.,Prime Video,59%,76%,41

10484,This Is Going to Hurt,1,"Hurt is the best medical drama in years because, instead of celebrating idealized superhuman doctors, it observes how broken systems force real doctors to attempt superhuman feats.",Prime Video,95%,97%,39
10485,This Is Going to Hurt,1,"The talent of Ben Whishaw shines on its highest beams in this medical series about Adam Kay, who left his career as a junior doctor in obstetrics at a London hospital to fictionalize his life into a comedy of shocking gravity. You’ll laugh till it hurts.",Prime Video,95%,97%,39

10880,Invincible,1,"With its fun '80s-inspired animation style and stellar voice cast, Invincible is worth checking out for superhero genre fans. That said, it offers very little that we haven't seen before.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10881,Invincible,1,"It's a very smart show, even if it's a bit too soon to tell if its many characters and elements will come together satisfactorily. With incredible talent behind it, Invincible is off to a very strong start.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81

10893,Invincible,1,"Invincible takes all the superhero tropes out there and turns them on its head, with a Mystery drama that combines the anxiety of the teenage world with ultra-violence and a dark sense of humor.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10894,Invincible,1,"The fights are exciting, the animation's top-notch, but that's just the icing on the cake. Deep down, it is great, grade-A, solid, relatable, interesting character storytelling.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10895,Invincible,1,"Replete with a solid score and many sequences of character development, Invincible relishes action sequences and character interactions as much as it does explicit gore, all with a wicked sense of humor.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10896,Invincible,1,I'm definitely inclined to keep watching. But the producers will have to work hard to ensure that the 40- to 45-minute episodes (the same length as an hourlong TV show with commercials) don't start to feel bloated.,Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10897,Invincible,1,A dark superhero series with similar beats you've seen before if you love the genre. The main drawback is that some of the main characters are not interesting enough to hold your attention like they should.,Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10898,Invincible,1,"With a great voice cast led by Oscar nominee Steven Yeun, this animated series does justice to Robert Kirkman's superhero comics.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81

10901,Invincible,1,"Superhero fans will probably enjoy the many hat tips to classic superheroes, and although the subversion of tropes may feel less surprising than they did back in the day, it'll still pack a punch for comic and superhero fans alike.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10902,Invincible,1,"Much like Amazon's massive superhero hit The Boys, it incorporates the iconography and character archetypes of more popular properties to give viewers something that still feels familiar and inviting.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81

10906,Invincible,1,"'Invincible' is ridiculously violent, but at the center of its superhero satire is a coming of age story surprisingly full of heart.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10907,Invincible,1,Some of the series' devices now seem less fresh than they did in 2003... but the show combats this by devoting serious screen time to building out the dynamics between its characters in ways big and small.,Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10908,Invincible,0,"But both the jokes and the character beats that fuel Invincible are too sporadic to make the series feel anything more than sputtering. Unassailable, it is not.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10909,Invincible,1,A big part of Invincible's charm is in the way it has little use for most of the traditional sources of drama in superhero storytelling.,Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10910,Invincible,1,There's likely going to be at least some of part of Invincible that piques your interest. But it's too early to say whether the whole season will pull together into something greater than its many parts.,Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10911,Invincible,1,It's well written and the animation style is retro-cool.,Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10912,Invincible,1,"Three episodes in, Invincible's a competent (and very close) adaptation conveyed by competent animation. However, the strength of the voicework suggests the show can offer increasingly more interesting stories as the season goes on.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81

10917,Invincible,1,"Indeed, streaming is awash in such fare... That sense of familiarity doesn't necessarily undermine Invincible on its merits, but it does make the exercise unavoidably feel a bit been there, seen that.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10918,Invincible,1,...it's nice to see at least one superhero property at least trying to capture the full spectrum of what makes us so annoyingly obsessed with them.,Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10919,Invincible,1,"Invincible is okay. As a piece of early 2000s nostalgia, it's fun enough, but it's just too dated, too cliche, and almost a bit too earnest to stand out in an entertainment landscape already packed with superhero entertainment.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81

10923,Invincible,1,"What both anchors and keeps Invincible compelling is its cast, packed to the brim with talent. As Mark, Yeun conveys a perfect combination of teenage insecurity, determination and occasional arrogance.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10924,Invincible,1,"This is everything I wanted The Boys series to be. An incisive, unblinking, shocking, and bloody look at the downside of superheroes and it has jokes too. I cannot wait to inhale the rest of the series",Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10925,Invincible,1,"The end result is bewildering, but also exhilarating, injecting energy into a simple power fantasy premise even as it carries the potential to alienate viewers looking for lighter fare.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10926,Invincible,1,"Like a good superhero comic, Invincible understands the value of unexpected twists and cliffhangers. And, like any comic hoping to keep its audience, it knows the value of getting off to a strong start.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10927,Invincible,1,"For now, we'll simply say that Invincible is one of the best new shows for genre fans and a worthy addition to the oversaturated superhero market.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10928,Invincible,1,"One of the best things about Invincible, though, is its stellar voice performances. While a lot of major characters get a chance to shine in the first three episodes, Steven Yeun's turn as Mark Grayson is particularly noteworthy.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10929,Invincible,1,"While the first three episodes made available for review don't quite sell the idea that Invincible has much new to bring to the genre, they will certainly speak to longstanding fans who've been waiting for this adaptation for years.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81

10934,Invincible,1,"The more extreme content can feel like Invincible is trying too hard to seem older, just in a different way from its title character. Still, it's fun, and Yeun, Simmons, and Oh make for a strong central ensemble.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10935,Invincible,1,"A faithful, epic, violent and wildly fun adaptation of Robert Kirkman's comic.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81

10938,Invincible,1,"These first episodes are a great primer for the series with good animation, good characters, and solid twists and turns.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81
10939,Invincible,1,"This superhero show may play it a bit safer than The Boys, which won't help it stand out in the current landscape of superhero content, but for now, it works and should satisfy fans of the comic, even if it doesn't reinvent the wheel.",Prime Video,98%,91%,81

11884,The Staircase,1,This nonlinear reexamination is as much about a possible murder as it is society’s insidious fascination with horrible tragedies.,Netflix,94%,82%,99
11885,The Staircase,1,"What if we asked instead why we form such intense attachments to people we can never truly know, or how a medium influences its message? They're issues that apply well beyond a single case...",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11886,The Staircase,1,"Michael and Kathleen are played by Colin Firth and Toni Collette, respectively, two well-distinguished actors who shine brightly and play well off of each other.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11887,The Staircase,1,There's a lot to like about this series.,Netflix,94%,82%,99
11888,The Staircase,1,"As a whole, The Staircase is a worthwhile watch, mainly for the performances by Firth, Posey and Collette. But you might get more satisfying information about the Peterson case by watching the documentary or docuseries.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11889,The Staircase,1,The Staircase winds up being a meta-text more than a murder mystery --and it’s a riveting one.,Netflix,94%,82%,99
11890,The Staircase,1,"Colin Firth plays Michael Peterson and does it with a rare kind of skill. If you think the case has been mined enough already, your mind is changed by Firth’s extraordinary subtlety as a man of many secrets and delusions.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11891,The Staircase,1,"The Staircase... defies expectations, adding new perspective and dimension to a well-known story while creating an experience that differs from the docuseries.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11892,The Staircase,1,"Colin Firth burns with intensity in this true-crime series that keeps you guessing if a bisexual novelist, politician, former marine and frequent liar pushed his wife (Toni Collette) to her death down the family staircase or whether she fell by accident.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11893,The Staircase,1,"If The Staircase (in all its iterations) embodies exploitative true crime trashiness, then I am its garbage disposal...",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11894,The Staircase,1,"If you didn’t know it was true, you wouldn’t believe it.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11895,The Staircase,1,"Despite the series’ predictability, the rabbit-hole appeal of the original story should keep plenty of viewers watching.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11896,The Staircase,1,The drama is compelling for the same reason the documentary was compelling...,Netflix,94%,82%,99
11897,The Staircase,1,"As Michael Peterson, Colin Firth manages to make us think he’s guilty as hell one minute, and possibly innocent the next. Toni Collette is touching as Kathleen.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11898,The Staircase,1,"Although there are still moments of something that skews uncomfortably close to fandom, revelations about the making of The Staircase cast everything that came before in a new light.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11899,The Staircase,1,"In this well-written series, Firth expertly plays a duplicitous man whose discovery of his wife’s body casts suspicion on him and divides his family.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11900,The Staircase,1,"While the episodes occasionally grind too slowly, Colin Firth's riveting work as the hard-to-read suspect elevates this HBO Max limited series several steps above standard true-crime fare.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11901,The Staircase,1,"[Colin] Firth plays [Michael] with aplomb, but [Toni] Collette’s portrayal of Kathleen truly shines.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11902,The Staircase,1,One might accuse the show of trying to have it both ways -- decrying our media culture of rapacious violence while indulging in it -- if both halves weren’t so carefully made and so probingly curious.,Netflix,94%,82%,99
11903,The Staircase,1,"It’s also a reminder of the genius of Colin Firth, who, as Michael Peterson, is at the center of the show and holds it expertly. It’s a cliché to say that an actor disappears into his role, but there it is",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11904,The Staircase,1,"It’s a pro job. But if you’re interested in the facts behind the fact-based fiction, there is little new to learn.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11905,The Staircase,1,"Led by an excellent Colin Firth, The Staircase is telly at its best.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11906,The Staircase,1,"In the end, its pleasures are rather cerebral, less a whodunit than a story about telling stories — and the omissions in hopeful service of a greater truth.",Netflix,94%,82%,99

11911,The Staircase,1,"The Staircase is both a masterful moment for an assured filmmaker, and it's the jolt that the true crime storytelling industry needs.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11912,The Staircase,0,"The problem is, in a good fictional crime story, the writers and directors feel a sense of responsibility to make you care. Here, there’s an underlying assumption that we’ll care, and that assumption leads to plodding, stultifying drama.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11913,The Staircase,1,"Though this drama tries and fails to reach the same heights as its predecessor, it nevertheless makes for gripping viewing.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11914,The Staircase,1,"The Staircase is intensely concerned with not just the mystery at hand, but with the mystery of all people, maybe all of life. Campos, who directed six episodes and ran the show with Maggie Cohn, fills the series with small and tantalizing detail.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11915,The Staircase,1,"It's not often that a dramatization of something that people already know about is told in such a nuanced way, but there truly is something for everyone here.",Netflix,94%,82%,99

11921,The Staircase,1,"Even as close as the documentary came in its pursuit of real answers, The Staircase doesn't offer much clarity beyond that, with no obvious answer amidst a legion of inscrutable mysteries that may never be unraveled.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11922,The Staircase,1,"It’s full of tricky, complicated ambiguities that are often riveting and sometimes just baffling... This is a series that seems to admit that a lot of true crime, or at least this one, is really a no-win slow descent into a tragic morass.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11923,The Staircase,1,"The linchpin of this delicate portrayal is Colin Firth’s performance as Michael. Best known for playing romantic leads and other charismatic types, he disappears, here, into a far murkier character.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11924,The Staircase,1,"It’s more than a “did he do it?” mystery; it’s an indictment of the vagaries of the criminal justice system, the narcissism of abusive men, and most of all, through Collette, it gives Kathleen some much-needed humanity.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11925,The Staircase,1,"Perhaps the focus of future chapters will be tighter, but as far as the premiere episodes are concerned, youd be better off watching the documentary series first, before chasing it with Firths acting masterclass.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11926,The Staircase,1,Colin Firth And Toni Collette Are Equally Strong In This Expansion Of The True Crime Saga.,Netflix,94%,82%,99
11927,The Staircase,1,"An intriguing and captivating miniseries that dives deeper than the documentary did. Twists and surprises are around every corner for those who don't know the story, but those who do will enjoy it as well.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11928,The Staircase,1,"Seriously, get this watched.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11929,The Staircase,1,"Where Making A Murderer dragged, The Staircase darts. Where Making A Murderer has you applauding your guesswork, The Staircase has you damned.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11930,The Staircase,1,"The Staircase functions best as a documentary looking intently on the shortcomings of the American legal system, and how things can become so convoluted and messy that both victims and the accused will never find justice, closure, or peace.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11931,The Staircase,1,"Most of us would like to think that, if we were in Michael Peterson's position, certain processes would be in place.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11932,The Staircase,1,"By the end of its examination of the ways a trial can be skewed by investigators and faux ""expert"" witnesses, you will never want to break the law and face a so-called jury of your peers.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11933,The Staircase,1,The sheer amount of archival footage in this show is absolutely nuts.,Netflix,94%,82%,99
11934,The Staircase,1,It makes for very powerful TV.,Netflix,94%,82%,99
11935,The Staircase,1,It's illuminating how flawed and nave the concept of blind justice is.,Netflix,94%,82%,99
11936,The Staircase,1,"This rotating cast of vampires and misfits not only makes for a thrillingly sloppy and mad case, it creates extraordinary telly, all whittled down from 16 years of footage.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11937,The Staircase,1,"If The Staircase is a puzzle, it's one that still works no matter how you decide to arrange the pieces.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11938,The Staircase,1,Unmissable stuff.,Netflix,94%,82%,99
11939,The Staircase,1,"It is a tragedy of epic proportions, sprawled out over 15 years. Days turn into weeks, weeks into months, months into years. The case drags on. Yet Kathleen Peterson remains dead, reduced to a series of graphic images, to pieces of bloody evidence.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11940,The Staircase,1,"Perhaps the greatest achievement of ""The Staircase""...is that you can watch all 13 episodes and ultimately still not be able to decide whether the protagonist, Michael Peterson, is guilty or innocent.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11941,The Staircase,1,Groundbreaking true crime documentary is still compelling.,Netflix,94%,82%,99

11945,The Staircase,1,"The Staircase is like a true-crime version of the Up series, albeit on a much more modest scale. It is compelling, but like many entries in this genre, not exactly an objective work of journalism.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11946,The Staircase,1,"The one-sidedness does mean you never get any sense of Kathleen...and certain questions go unanswered...Still, it's 13 hours you won't mind never getting back.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11947,The Staircase,0,"To call The Staircase a docu-series is a gross exaggeration. It is filmed entirely from the perspective of Peterson's team, an overwrought exploration of a self-involved family.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11948,The Staircase,1,"There's a lot of waiting around, a lot of eavesdropping on the minutiae and small-talk of the legal system. But that offers its own insights.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11949,The Staircase,1,"The Staircase leaves you with an understanding not of how righteous justice is, but how evasive for so many, and how the best investigative work is thorough and slow-like the documentary itself.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11950,The Staircase,1,"This three-tiered telling of ""The Staircase"" -- which builds, step by methodical step, on what transpired before -- is an extremely shrewd demonstration of getting maximum bang for its bucks.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11951,The Staircase,1,"The Staircase demonstrates how to ride the wave of a sensational true story, zooming in on fine details before pulling back to unleash game-changing revelations at the steady rate of one stunner per episode.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11952,The Staircase,1,"It's tricky to write about this series without giving spoilers and, by dint of it being a trial drama, it's much more satisfying...",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11953,The Staircase,1,"Every episode is more in-depth than the last, making this series and its two sequels one of the most thorough true crime projects ever created.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11954,The Staircase,1,"Should the outcome go one way or the other at any point in the game, one wouldn't necessarily be surprised. Engrossed, yes. And hungry for more.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11955,The Staircase,1,"With the right approach, a complicated whodunit can supply truths about the best and worst of the human condition, even when the ""truth"" of the case is destined to remain beyond our grasp.",Netflix,94%,82%,99

11957,The Staircase,1,"The level of detail is astonishing -- not a scintilla of the storyline is tossed aside. It's a terrific, troubling case to fall into and a sublime summer distraction in the true-crime genre.",Netflix,94%,82%,99
11958,The Staircase,1,It's a must-watch for anyone interested in true crime shows as it's not only a fascinating case on its own but really the template for so much that's on television and streaming services today.,Netflix,94%,82%,99
11959,The Staircase,1,"Far more than just a riveting mystery about whether Michael Peterson is a killer, this expanded version of The Staircase is a warts-and-all portrait of the frustrating intricacies of the American judicial system.",Netflix,94%,82%,99

11965,Better Call Saul,1,"Now in its final season, Better Call Saul remains just as expansively cinematic and claustrophobically tense as ever it was, with creators Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould still masters of their desert domain.",Netflix,98%,96%,35

11969,Better Call Saul,1,Season six is yet another reminder that Better Call Saul has not only stepped out from under Breaking Bad‘s shadow but developed a confident identity as its own series chronicling the slow and steady demise of its protagonists.,Netflix,98%,96%,35
11970,Better Call Saul,1,"Everything that made its earlier seasons fantastic is here in season 6, only turned up to 11. The acting is still phenomenal, the writing is top-notch, the cinematography remains stunning yet understated, and the subtle touches and motifs are all there.",Netflix,98%,96%,35
11971,Better Call Saul,1,"It's still the most extraordinary, riveting drama on TV, substantially because of its emphasis on showing and implying before scripting what it's thinking.",Netflix,98%,96%,35

12005,Breaking Bad,1,"This wasn't a jaw-dropping finale, but that's largely because it was a jaw-dropped television show. Gilligan didn't save any rounds for the concluding episode. He emptied them as he went along.",Netflix,96%,97%,98

12101,Shameless,0,Shameless fails many of its other characters when it comes to their conclusions. The series even does it in such a way where it feels like the show made a deliberate choice to avoid giving a solid ending to anyone's arc.,Netflix,82%,81%,10
12102,Shameless,1,The swan song of the Emmy winner still has some surprises up its stain-tattered and still glorious sleeve.,Netflix,82%,81%,10
12103,Shameless,1,"The finale is actually a pretty apt metaphor for communities in transition periods. It raises the question of who actually benefits from amenities and development, even if it doesn't answer those questions completely, and there's poignance in that.",Netflix,82%,81%,10
12104,Shameless,1,"I love this show, messy flaws, brazen outrageousness, frenetic pacing, offensive story lines, hyper-farcical turns and all. It's not a Breaking Bad or a Mad Men, a pair of near-perfect specimens, but it has the kind of humanity that inspires my devotion.",Netflix,82%,81%,10

12120,Supernatural,1,"Supernatural starts out the final season in the best way it possibly can. Dean and Castiel one liners, an appreciation for its history, and new stakes to carry them through the final season.",Netflix,93%,75%,12
12121,Supernatural,1,I was already excited for this season and the big fight facing the Winchesters. It's not fair to throw amazing fan service and heart-warming quotes at me. My feelings just don't stand a chance this season.,Netflix,93%,75%,12

12134,You,1,"In Season 3, You has room to unpack the full potential of that twist. The show is no longer about a single predator who fixates on women; it's about a couple of predators who have to balance their own impulses...",Netflix,91%,76%,56
12135,You,1,"You remains a twisted guilty pleasure that will entertain its most fervent fans, but my own obsession with it is waning unless it shows me something more.",Netflix,91%,76%,56
12136,You,1,"The show's latest round of episodes may comprise its best outing yet. After a second season that lulled in the middle, You's third outing doesn't let up.",Netflix,91%,76%,56
12137,You,1,"You is a sly guilty pleasure as such things go. Joe's prolific and wry inner dialogue narrates and critiques the action, ensuring that we see him as weird, funny, appealing, carnal, sexy and menacing.",Netflix,91%,76%,56
12138,You,1,This was a really solid season... [Victoria Pedretti and Penn Badgley] playing opposite each other is really strong.,Netflix,91%,76%,56

12140,You,1,"What began as one-note thriller about a dangerous stalker became a savage spoof of internet-era relationships and, this season, a savage mockery of marriage and domestic bliss. It's crazy but so, so smart. Love it.",Netflix,91%,76%,56
12141,You,1,"YOU Season 3 elevates the series out of its pulpy beginnings and into more grounded drama. ... Fans of the show will enjoy the same potent blend of sensual heat and spine-tingling chills, but with a new and more anchored approach",Netflix,91%,76%,56

12150,You,1,You's third season is like watching a collision from the sidelines; you're unable to look away because you want to see who walks away.,Netflix,91%,76%,56
12151,You,1,"It promises the same two-faced neighborhood drama, hilarious delusions, literary references, and misplaced self-righteousness that got us hooked before but leaves plenty of room for uncertainty on how the plot unfurls.",Netflix,91%,76%,56
12152,You,1,"The season, ultimately, is a raging success, yet my goodness, there's a lot here.",Netflix,91%,76%,56
12153,You,0,"More and more, the show seems to be saying, Joe's struggles are just a slightly amped-up version of the viewer's own. He's ""You."" But there's too much grotesque violence in the show's past for us to relate to him, or to take the show on its own terms.",Netflix,91%,76%,56
12154,You,1,"You is gonna You, and it Yous spectacularly. Come for the glass box, stay to find out who goes in it, and watch it all go down in flames because you don't dare to look away.",Netflix,91%,76%,56

12157,You,1,"A stalker drama can be fun, but it's got nothing on the murder-romp possibilities of a serial killer Mr. and Mrs. Smith, where no one trusts anyone else but also someone needs to finish up the murdering in time to take over child-care duties.",Netflix,91%,76%,56
12158,You,1,"Though it can be overstuffed at times, You balances brazen humor with emotional intelligence, all while keeping the mystery intact.",Netflix,91%,76%,56
12159,You,1,"Pedretti's performance is a delicious mix of rage and bougie suburban white lady privilege, a chaotic tour de force that's every bit as messy and reactionary as Badgley's Joe is removed and calculating.",Netflix,91%,76%,56
12160,You,1,"While it is always good fun to see Badgely deliver Joe's narcissism and delusional but witty outlook on romance, it has to be said that Pedretti really is the most valuable and interesting figure in the third run.",Netflix,91%,76%,56
12161,You,1,"You would be better served by not stopping to make excuses for Joe's behavior at this juncture, because it's actually at its best when it doesn't apologize for being a juicy, twisted thriller.",Netflix,91%,76%,56
12162,You,1,The change is scenery has stopped You from feeling stale. The pacing is quick and the twists rarely expected. The third season of this Netflix show continues to be a bingeable delight,Netflix,91%,76%,56

12168,You,1,"As outlandish as the story gets this time around, the third season of You may be the most self-aware and entertaining yet. Viewers will be constantly breathing a sigh of relief, followed by the inevitable decision that keeps the series moving.",Netflix,91%,76%,56
12169,You,1,"Philosophical musings aside, You re-establishes itself as pure binge-able television, playing up the twists and cliffhangers that we've all come to expect.",Netflix,91%,76%,56
12170,You,1,"While Season 3 certainly doesn't disappoint, the disclaimer would be that this is one of those shows -- like spiritual daddy Dexter, which makes its own return next month -- where less might ultimately be more in contemplating the length of its run.",Netflix,91%,76%,56
12171,You,1,"This latest season of You does not disappoint. It brings back all the aspects of the show that fans love, adding new characters in a new setting, giving our toxic protagonists a new array of lives to infect.",Netflix,91%,76%,56
12172,You,1,"The writers have a great time skewering them all, and while some subjects they include may be easy targets (anti-vaxxers and dull married suburban life, for example), they are featured in often surprising - and deliciously dark - ways.",Netflix,91%,76%,56

12197,Lucifer,1,"All in all, this is a bit of a mess of a final season, and it's hard to decide if it is a mess that works to the series' benefit or if it's a detriment to the absolute highs that Season 6 hits. Because when Season 6 is good, it is absolutely fantastic.",Netflix,88%,73%,14

12202,The 100,1,"Listen, I am here for this futuristic alien vibe that's going on with the anomaly. It's weird, and I think we deserve a break from the us vs. them / ""are we good? are we bad?"" themes that this show has overdone a bit by now.",Netflix,93%,66%,8
12203,The 100,1,"While we've only seen four of the final season's extended sixteen-episode run, it's evident that challenge is more relevant than ever to the themes of the story The 100 wants to tell",Netflix,93%,66%,8
12204,The 100,1,"Season seven seems to additionally have the capacity to recycle a considerable amount of the same threads and concepts from past seasons, while seemingly not proving that they can tie them together to make a cathartic ending.",Netflix,93%,66%,8

12217,Black Mirror,0,The fifth season of Black Mirror isn't necessary bad -- each episode has a glimmer of something exciting -- but unfortunately that didn't quite go far enough.,Netflix,84%,83%,41
12218,Black Mirror,1,"Overall, this season offers relatively lighter fare for what can typically be an extremely heady, dark watch. And outside of a few pieces of tech, these stories could very much play out in the real world today.",Netflix,84%,83%,41
12219,Black Mirror,1,Black Mirror still feels right - precisely because it feels so wrong.,Netflix,84%,83%,41
12220,Black Mirror,1,It may not be on the level of classic Black Mirror... but it's still a fine place to look for digital-era self-reflection. Just don't expect this run of episodes to break your brain.,Netflix,84%,83%,41
12221,Black Mirror,1,"Even with only three new episodes to watch, season 5 of Black Mirror delivers. All three episodes are worth watching - some more than once!",Netflix,84%,83%,41
12222,Black Mirror,1,The kind of anthology show that proved the possibilities of television 60 years ago... No one does the year 2025 like Black Mirror.,Netflix,84%,83%,41
12223,Black Mirror,1,"This season of Black Mirror is softer than previous entries, but this change of pace isn't wholly unwelcome. It's nice to see that Brooker isn't obsessed with making his content 'edgy for edges' sake.",Netflix,84%,83%,41

12226,Black Mirror,1,"For a show that's built its brand on nihilistic spirals, there's something heartening in watching Black Mirror embrace the audacity of hope.",Netflix,84%,83%,41
12227,Black Mirror,0,"The three episodes combine, however, to make for a slight and overly long viewing experience.",Netflix,84%,83%,41
12228,Black Mirror,1,"A shorter season of ""Black Mirror"" brings this show back to its roots in how it feels more immediate and plausible... these more contained fables have the eerie effect working like a true mirror to how we live and feel today.",Netflix,84%,83%,41

12232,Black Mirror,1,"Black Mirror's fifth season is one of the series' best, with a condensed batch of new stories that deliver great storytelling, interesting characters, and fascinating technologies that don't overshadow Charlie Brooker's deeply personal stories.",Netflix,84%,83%,41
12233,Black Mirror,1,"The new trio of stories still pack a punch, with Brooker putting social media giants and the music industry in his satirical crosshairs.",Netflix,84%,83%,41
12234,Black Mirror,0,"Brooker still has the teeth - and the imagination to craft tales that link into our techno-paranoia, showing us a world gone wrong where we are not too careful - but the bite is somewhat lacking.",Netflix,84%,83%,41

12238,Black Mirror,1,"Watching Black Mirror's three brand-new installments on Netflix makes it clear that the series, in our current TV universe, claims and holds the fantasy anthology series crown.",Netflix,84%,83%,41
12239,Black Mirror,0,"Such dissonance underscores the impression, supported by the occasional but conspicuous Britishisms that issue from the mouths of American characters in the Netflix seasons, that Brooker isn't getting enough feedback on his scripts.",Netflix,84%,83%,41
12240,Black Mirror,1,"These episodes are lighter than you might expect from Black Mirror. There's no pitch-black Crocodile in amongst this batch, and one of them is positively a romp, but that's not to say that the themes aren't heavy.",Netflix,84%,83%,41
12241,Black Mirror,1,"Series five, newly out on Netflix, consists of only three episodes but each is richly suggestive, cunningly plotted and captivatingly played.",Netflix,84%,83%,41
12242,Black Mirror,0,"It's weird to feel so poorly about three arguably good episodes of television, but the short length of Season 5 only serves to highlight the deficiencies of the season as a whole.",Netflix,84%,83%,41
12243,Black Mirror,1,"Any anthology is going to yield somewhat uneven results, but Brooker's hitting percentage has been pretty envious. By that measure, a homerun, a single and a pop up isn't bad, but ""Striking Vipers"" is the one that really draws blood.",Netflix,84%,83%,41
12244,Black Mirror,1,"The three instalments vary in mood, genre and just about everything else (as anthologies are designed to do) but they share a new air of calm authority.",Netflix,84%,83%,41
12245,Black Mirror,1,"As the world around us becomes more and more unstable, Black Mirror now finds itself in a precarious position. How can your dystopian sci-fi show compete with the actual impending actual dystopia?",Netflix,84%,83%,41
12246,Black Mirror,0,"The fifth series of Black Mirror is comprised of episodes that feel less like the work of Brooker and more like thin, wanting knock-offs that were inspired by him.",Netflix,84%,83%,41
12247,Black Mirror,1,"It's slower, more methodical, and not at all what you're expecting. But there's a reason for just about every tonal choice, and it helps to deliver a brilliantly written and emotion-driven journey.",Netflix,84%,83%,41
12248,Black Mirror,1,"Season 5 can't help but feel like a placeholder, something created only to fulfil certain contractual obligations, or perhaps to buy Charlie Brooker more time to create the next Bandersnatch.",Netflix,84%,83%,41

12251,Attack on Titan,1,"Shishido's direction did not manage to communicate so eloquently the increasingly complex narrative, although the fault lies at least as much on the original material. The one thing he does pretty well, however, is bring all the storylines together",Netflix,96%,95%,3
12252,Attack on Titan,1,"Te final season's premiere continues Attack on Titan's deft focus on the no-win hell that is war, and while fans may miss those familiar faces, the new additions to the cast and their side of the story are sure to impress.",Netflix,96%,95%,3
12253,Riverdale,1,"Riverdale itself just embracing the utter insanity of the source material, especially when it’s done such a grand job of being so insane itself previously, is more of a lateral move than some huge leap.",Netflix,80%,51%,5

12255,Riverdale,1,"They've exaggerated their plots before and played with outlandish stories, but this 5-episode event series seems to be their way of embracing the full supernatural horror.",Netflix,80%,51%,5
12256,Riverdale,1,"For now, Rivervale is a deliciously fun place to be. Deep in the horror genre, it's a new twist on old structures, filled with high stakes, age-old curses, major character deaths, and a top-notch 4th wall-breaking narrator.",Netflix,80%,51%,5

12358,The Haunting of Hill House,1,The best haunted-house stories aren't scary because they're filled with a long lineup of ghosties and ghoulies. They're scary because they want something from the haunted.,Netflix,93%,91%,103

12362,The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Hill House is fiercely slow-burning, but can also unleash a deluge of frights at a moment's notice. Audiences won't want it to stop, and it won't...for ten episodes, anyway.",Netflix,93%,91%,103

12365,The Haunting of Hill House,1,"It's not just the family premise that makes this series so brilliant, but the characters as individuals themselves.

12366,The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The real marvel of The Haunting Of Hill House is in its execution. Plot threads that initially may seem to go nowhere, or seem obvious, actually have welcome, complicated layers that reveal the relatable family dynamics...",Netflix,93%,91%,103
12367,The Haunting of Hill House,1,"[It] unfolds at too plodding a pace... But once the series establishes its storytelling approach, it hooks you in, compelling you to keep watching until certain mysteries are resolved.",Netflix,93%,91%,103
12368,The Haunting of Hill House,0,This Haunting is so far from the original source material that it's more of a demolition than adaptation.,Netflix,93%,91%,103

12373,The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Like everything in Hill House, that terror gets muted, slowed down and picked over so much that it ends up banal and lifeless.",Netflix,93%,91%,103
12374,The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The childhood/adulthood flashbacks are as good as This Is Us, the horror better than Hereditary, the whole thing better than the similar Castle Rock and Sharp Objects.",Netflix,93%,91%,103
12375,The Haunting of Hill House,1,What makes this rendition of Jackson's story so fascinating is the role femininity and domesticity plays in possessing the lives of a couple and shattering their family so completely that only a tragedy can bring them together as adults.,Netflix,93%,91%,103
12376,The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Some may find the story's slow-burning nature frustrating, but like Castle Rock, it's refreshing to see a psychological horror evolve a little more naturally than the usual rapid escalation.",Netflix,93%,91%,103
12377,The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Written and directed by Mike Flanagan, ""The Haunting of Hill House"" practically oozes with gothic horror. Dread, foreboding and general creepiness lurk around every corner in ways seldom seen on television.",Netflix,93%,91%,103
12378,The Haunting of Hill House,1,"But it's a series that will stick in people's minds - not because of the familiar things it does, but for all the things it dares to do differently.",Netflix,93%,91%,103
12379,The Haunting of Hill House,1,"There's something in the air ahead of a Flanagan scare. You know it's coming, but not from where. And that tension gnaws at you, curdling your stomach, pulling your fingertips to your agape mouth and maybe up over your wide eyes. It's a divine thrill.",Netflix,93%,91%,103
12380,The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The Haunting of Hill House is a kind of riff on madness in its many forms, a sojourn of loss and regret.",Netflix,93%,91%,103
12381,The Haunting of Hill House,1,The Haunting of Hill House is decent and very much strives for a more classical horror vibe relying less on gore and more on supernatural scares.,Netflix,93%,91%,103
12382,The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The Haunting of Hill House is a frequently scary, surprisingly emotional saga focused on both past and present. Director Mike Flanagan takes Shirley Jackson's iconic haunted house novel and works into something wholly different, yet equally effective.",Netflix,93%,91%,103
12383,The Haunting of Hill House,1,"It's as though Flanagan has taken Jackson's original work, shattered it and then rearranged the pieces to create a completely original, but equally brilliant tale.",Netflix,93%,91%,103
12384,The Haunting of Hill House,1,"This is a new version of The Haunting for a new time, when the term 'ghosting' means something else entirely, and, although it's not always completely successful in its balancing of horror and heart.",Netflix,93%,91%,103
12385,The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Slowly insinuating, building in power as it tells a story of repressed trauma and family discord. It's an effective scare-fest that is at its best when the tale does more than jolt the viewer.",Netflix,93%,91%,103
12386,Altered Carbon,0,"For intriguing sci-fi action, stick with that strong first season. For the big questions, fellow Netflix original The Good Place is just a few short clicks away.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12387,Altered Carbon,1,"Altered Carbon's biggest asset is its visually amazing universe, and the endless possibilities that come with it. Season 2 is somewhat better than 1. [Full review in Spanish]",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12388,Altered Carbon,0,"It had good moments, it had bad moments, it had dull moments. I kind of wish now that there was just Season 1 standing alone as a great example of the genre...",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12389,Altered Carbon,1,"We're offered a bold new performance by Anthony Mackie, and this season also brings in exciting new characters while greatly exploring returning ones.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12390,Altered Carbon,1,"Season 2 might seem like it has a lot of unnecessary layers to it, however, once you give those said layers time to grow, and a much closer look, then you'll see that there is a lot to be adored.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12391,Altered Carbon,1,The action remains intense; it's just got more meaning.,Netflix,75%,64%,36
12392,Altered Carbon,1,"Mackie gives Kovacs a suitable sort of intensity and loose-limbed physicality... New showrunner Alison Schapker (Lost, Fringe) continues expanding a fascinating world out of the novels by Richard K. Morgan.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12393,Altered Carbon,1,"At first it was hard to see where this season was going, and it seemed a bit less interesting than season 1. But ultimately, by the time you reach the end, it's hard not to be satisfied with the journey and the finale.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12394,Altered Carbon,1,"It continues the overall premise of the first season while introducing a new lead, a new case and fresh cosmic terrains for interstellar action scenes. And it's still a lot of fun to follow.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12395,Altered Carbon,1,"...sprawling, dense, fun, and weird as hell.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12396,Altered Carbon,1,"It is strangely reassuring to know that, even in the 24th century, wearing a scuffed leather jacket over a black hoodie is still the universal symbol of anti-hero cool.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12397,Altered Carbon,1,"Mackie feels like an upgrade on Kinnaman generally, although the overheated voiceover isn't doing him any favors.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12398,Altered Carbon,1,"The distinct episodes help keep viewers invested when ""Altered Carbon"" goes too heavy on diegetic mumbo jumbo or changes its own rules to set up silly twists.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12399,Altered Carbon,1,"Anthony Mackie and Will Yun Lee's stellar performances save this often underwhelming second season of Altered Carbon, and while it remains enjoyable and exciting viewing, the series might now benefit from a reboot.",Netflix,75%,64%,36

12401,Altered Carbon,1,"The story manages to breathe and present us something that is, directly, more entertaining. [Full Review in Spanish]",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12402,Altered Carbon,1,"Thankfully, it seems creator Laeta Kalogridis and the series producers have taken this on board, and this time around there's not a ridiculously see-through gown or inexplicable nude scene in sight.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12403,Altered Carbon,1,"It's no secret Mackie is a Hollywood veteran, but this is the first time he has had eight hours of screen time to stretch his legs as one character - and he is fantastic.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12404,Altered Carbon,0,"The ideas behind the premise are so good, the potential to examine existential issues about identity and humanity and how they're tied up in our physical form are so great, that it's frustrating to see how often the show takes a too-shallow approach.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12405,Altered Carbon,1,"Altered Carbon also succeeds at the level of breathtaking spectacle. After a stuttering first season, a would-be blockbuster has belatedly but emphatically achieved lift-off.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12406,Altered Carbon,1,"By the season finale, it becomes clear that this has stopped being the Kovacs show and, instead, an ensemble endeavour that manages to satisfyingly tie up a season arc while teasing storylines yet to be explored.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12407,Altered Carbon,1,"It still falls short of its potential, but Altered Carbon has probably done enough to ensure it runs for years to come. A lump of graphite, if not quite the full diamond.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12408,Altered Carbon,0,"I found myself desperately wishing for Altered Carbon to leave its world of endless lives, satellite back ups, and shapeless political revolutions behind, to focus... on the AIs discarded by humanity as yet another resource to be wasted and forgotten.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12409,Altered Carbon,1,"Initially, Kovacs investigating the death of yet another meth is worrisome, but Altered Carbon manages to switch gears and deliver a much more cohesive and emotionally grounded season.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12410,Altered Carbon,1,"Few TV shows manage to get the writing, acting, and directing right, but the second season of Altered Carbon will keep people talking for months, if not years after it hits the air.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12411,Altered Carbon,1,"It combines what worked best in the show's first year with a more intimate and important mystery, which makes for a more compelling story.",Netflix,75%,64%,36

12413,Altered Carbon,1,"Altered Carbon takes place in the future, but its message stands firmly in the now.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12414,Altered Carbon,1,"Altered Carbon is in good hands with Anthony Mackie taking the role of Kovacs in season 2, and first few episodes outline a strong story that honors both the original character and the introductory adventure in all its dark and violent glory.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12415,Altered Carbon,1,"It's not without its issues, and some of the acting and writing does get very trite in places, but by and large, 'Altered Carbon' Season 2 proves itself to be an intriguing, entertaining dive into pulpy cyberpunk silliness.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12416,Altered Carbon,0,"This season lays hard into the sci-fi and moves away from the stronger narrative ties that would lend the story to its noir roots. While still a cool show hiring dope and diverse actors, I can't help but want more from the show.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12417,Altered Carbon,1,The personal touches keep the characters grounded even when they're waxing poetic about the nature of life and their place in the universe.,Netflix,75%,64%,36
12418,Altered Carbon,0,"Altered Carbon has an amazing sandbox to work with, but the story doesn't always know how to play in it... The good news is that Season 2 ends on a note that could make Season 3 its best yet.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12419,Altered Carbon,1,"While we're not quite there yet, future seasons of Altered Carbon will hopefully fix those aforementioned issues entirely, creating something that can truly ""stack"" up to the sci-fi greats that Morgan so readily draws inspiration from.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12420,Altered Carbon,1,"This season is less horrifying, less gruesome and in some ways a little less bombastic, but it's also maybe a little more nuanced or less melodramatic.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12421,Altered Carbon,1,"Boasts a leaner, more easily digestible cyberpunk thriller than its predecessor with surprise new sleeves, new characters and superbly crafted action.",Netflix,75%,64%,36
12422,13 Reasons Why,1,"Awkward, complex and extremely difficult to watch, It doesn't go out on a fluffy high, but stays true to its issues and discussing difficult subjects, it would break most strong-minded adults, let alone vulnerable teens.",Netflix,35%,57%,12
12423,13 Reasons Why,1,"While season four has its bumps in the road, the lens does not falter, keeping its focus locked on the wreckage these teens not only create for themselves but the issues the world has created for them.",Netflix,35%,57%,12
12424,13 Reasons Why,0,The team behind 13 Reasons Why had no way of knowing that audiences would be watching this season in the middle of a pandemic. But that only makes the sadistic nature of the material that much more glaring.,Netflix,35%,57%,12
12425,13 Reasons Why,0,"The show's myopia isn't surprising. If anything, the final season proves once again that teen viewers deserved better than what 13 Reasons Why offered, and if the show is remembered in a few years, it'll be mostly for what it failed to do.",Netflix,35%,57%,12

12428,13 Reasons Why,1,"It's not always successful, but it does have its moments, offering up some refreshing character journeys along the way. As for some of the more infuriating moments, they are, as always, elevated by an incredibly talented cast.",Netflix,35%,57%,12

12431,13 Reasons Why,0,"Laves nothing to chance, wrapping up almost every major loose end in what is now surely the show's trademark: throw every possible hot button issue into a blender and mash the switch labeled ""the power of friendship and de-escalation"" until smooth.",Netflix,35%,57%,12

12441,Community,1,"The spirit largely remains intact: Specifically, the world is mad. So is Greendale. So is Dan Harmon. Did I say I love Paget Brewster? I do. And the refurbished, reborn, reconstituted, regenerated, re-undead Community? That too.",Netflix,88%,88%,37
12442,Community,1,"For all intents and purposes, this technologically resurrected Community still feels like Community, just, you know, a little different.",Netflix,88%,88%,37
12443,Community,1,"The series feels truly smaller for the first time... That said, the extra time allows for funny gags to go on longer as well.",Netflix,88%,88%,37
12444,Community,1,"A fitting farewell for the folks of Greendale, as the entire series perfectly collapsed in on itself in a glorious, hilarious, and bittersweet fashion.",Netflix,88%,88%,37

12453,Community,1,"The Yahoo version of Community seems rather scaled-down, budget-wise, and looser and less urgent than NBC seasons (running times vary). But it still feels, moves, and thinks like the Community you know.",Netflix,88%,88%,37

12459,Community,1,"It might not be exactly the same, but it's still better than most shows in its genre are.",Netflix,88%,88%,37

12467,Community,0,it's hard to shake the feeling that Community's continued existence has taken precedence over purpose. It's an overall diminishment that isn't helped by the shrinking cast.,Netflix,88%,88%,37

12472,The Umbrella Academy,1,"In the end, The Umbrella Academy Season 3 is a mix of cute moments, a predictable plot, and some laughs. It’s an enjoyable watch, but easy to see the building blocks of the story and ultimately, feels like it falls flat.",Netflix,85%,78%,41

12482,The Umbrella Academy,0,"This is the most apocalyptic-y apocalypse ever, but it carries no real weight. Then when you find out what has to be done to save the universe, it just feels very underwhelming. Samurais, really?",Netflix,85%,78%,41
12483,The Umbrella Academy,1,"Gloriously weird, refreshingly progressive, and happily pulling out every stop on the way to the alternate timeline plot generator, The Umbrella Academy is its own damn animal, and indifferent to any gripes from those unwilling to climb aboard.",Netflix,85%,78%,41
12484,The Umbrella Academy,0,"Once the latest blueprint is established, the assorted subplots yield diminishing returns, indulging in strange detours while building toward the inevitable faceoff with the amorphous threat.",Netflix,85%,78%,41

12489,The Umbrella Academy,1,"Season 3 takes plenty of chances and nails a few of them. The inclusion of The Sparrow Academy is somewhat underwhelming, but there are more than a few great moments and characters to come from that.",Netflix,85%,78%,41
12490,The Umbrella Academy,1,"The second half of the season speeds up quite a bit with the last three episodes hitting the accelerator to their finale, leaving me wanting more, sooner rather than later. Full review in Spanish.",Netflix,85%,78%,41
12491,The Umbrella Academy,1,"If perhaps the weakest season so far by a nose, The Umbrella Academy’s third go-around largely reaffirms the show’s singularly irreverent spirit.",Netflix,85%,78%,41
12492,The Umbrella Academy,1,"The third season of has many ups and downs, but it will be highly enjoyable for fans of the characters and the general tone. While it retains the mind-bending time-jump horror of the source material, it struggles with handling so many characters",Netflix,85%,78%,41
12493,The Umbrella Academy,1,The Umbrella Academy has found a formula that works and manages to make it feel new each time. I enjoyed this season quite a bit because it offered a return to established characters but manages to make them even more interesting than before.,Netflix,85%,78%,41

12495,The Umbrella Academy,1,"While The Umbrella Academy borrows plot points from Way and Bá’s The Umbrella Academy: Hotel Oblivion, Netflix’s series is much more interested in digging deeper into its own continuity that showrunner Steve Blackman takes in surprising new directions.",Netflix,85%,78%,41
12496,The Umbrella Academy,1,It’s intriguing to see different arcs for each sibling based on the traumas they’ve experienced in previous seasons. The show handles the mix of emotions and overall stunted and complex love each sibling has for both themselves and others well.,Netflix,85%,78%,41
12497,The Umbrella Academy,1,"A compelling whirlwind of action that often sacrifices character beats and emotional weight for convoluted plot developments, but, nevertheless, remains a lot of fun.",Netflix,85%,78%,41

12499,The Umbrella Academy,1,"Three seasons in, the writers have finally ironed out all of those kinks, creating a hilarious, explosive, and highly addictive hit. This is the best season yet, one that will floor fans and win over any cynics.",Netflix,85%,78%,41
12500,The Umbrella Academy,0,"Gets off to a great start, but falls apart halfway through. Klaus still gets a fantastic storyline, however fellow fan favorite Five is basically benched while Allison suffers character assassination. Elliot Page's transition is handled respectfully.",Netflix,85%,78%,41
12501,The Umbrella Academy,1,Season 3 is a frustrating mix ... delivering exceptional arcs for certain characters while making baffling decisions with others.,Netflix,85%,78%,41
12502,The Umbrella Academy,0,The writers seem happy to undercut their big turns and moves without really mining them for their full emotional worth.,Netflix,85%,78%,41
12503,The Umbrella Academy,1,"It may initially seem less inventive and action-packed than previous seasons, but what it loses in wackiness, it gains in heart and the clarity of its message -- one that resonates whether your family is screwing up the timeline or not.",Netflix,85%,78%,41
12504,The Umbrella Academy,1,"Season 3 blends together the moodiness of Season 1 with the brisk-pacing, bizarro nature, and enormous heart of Season 2. In fact, the third season of The Umbrella Academy may just be the most emotional and personal season yet.",Netflix,85%,78%,41
12505,The Umbrella Academy,1,"The talent it takes to balance the varying tones and madness of The Umbrella Academy is vast. And then there is such tenderness, so much love that bleeds but glows at the precipice of disaster.",Netflix,85%,78%,41
12506,The Umbrella Academy,1,"This season might be the weakest of the three, yet it remains a wholly entertaining series that is unlike anything else being produced on television. It's a shame that Netflix doesn't want the world to enjoy it to its fullest potential.",Netflix,85%,78%,41

12520,Man vs. Bee,0,"It’s always a bad sign when a comedian resorts to dog doody for a laugh, yet that’s the level Rowan Atkinson sinks to here. And he doesn’t step in it, he face-plants it. This, from the guy who gave us Mr Bean and Blackadder? That's not funny. That’s sad.",Netflix,62%,62%,16
12521,Man vs. Bee,0,"While Atkinson’s performance is as commandingly skilful as you would expect, at times it is about as much fun as a boot stamping on a human face for ever, to borrow from George Orwell.",Netflix,62%,62%,16
12522,Man vs. Bee,1,"t’s a surprisingly good -- if one-note -- comedy fit for family viewing, and it made me laugh out loud multiple times.",Netflix,62%,62%,16
12523,Man vs. Bee,1,"Atkinson has lost none of his skill and you will watch it quite happily, but it just lacks the genius of Mr Bean.",Netflix,62%,62%,16
12524,Man vs. Bee,1,"As you’d expect from a Netflix production, it’s smartly produced and directed, and Atkinson as Bingley is much more engaging than Bean, and is still game enough to spend much of his time on screen in his underpants.",Netflix,62%,62%,16

12527,Man vs. Bee,1,"I’ve always felt, I now realise wrongly, that Atkinson’s best comedy was verbal and that Mr Bean and Johnny English were chiefly of interest to the lucrative dimwit demographic. What I should have appreciated is the continuity of Atkinson’s oeuvre.",Netflix,62%,62%,16

12538,Stranger Things,1,"The show has matured past riffing on early-80s action-adventure movies, such as The Goonies; now, it's onto slashers and other horror films, complete with new characters called Fred and Jason.

12568,Stranger Things,1,"The '80s horror influences inspired the Duffer brothers to make a tonal shift from the prior seasons, easily making Stranger Things 4 the darkest and longest — and possibly most entertaining — entry yet.",Netflix,91%,91%,128

12601,Stranger Things,1,"For every welcome moment of dread and (fortunately) equal moment of comedy, not to mention some cool monsters, there are sequences that remind us of just how much is going on. It’s a lot to remember, but if you’re a diehard, it’s no doubt worth it.",Netflix,91%,91%,128
12602,Stranger Things,0,"The new season stretches out the most basic plot lines beyond their breaking point, the most unbearably dull belonging to David Harbour’s former chief of police Hopper. He cheated death during last season’s finale to end up in narrative purgatory.",Netflix,91%,91%,128

13113,Squid Game,0,"Like Joker, there's a having-it-both-ways insistence that a culture that could create violence is inherently sick and deranged, while playing out a wildly overstated version of sick derangement in a manner designed to be maximally tense and amusing.",Netflix,95%,83%,73

13121,Squid Game,1,"As social commentary, it mostly works. As a show about brutal, larger-than-life games to the death, it also mostly works... But as far as final acts go, Squid Game stumbled pretty badly.",Netflix,95%,83%,73
13122,Squid Game,1,"What writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk has done principally involves serving old wine in a new bottle. Seen that way, ""Squid Game"" presents a visually arresting variation on themes seen plenty of times before, which include tapping into the class divide.",Netflix,95%,83%,73
13123,Squid Game,1,[It] never makes its action look glamorous. Its intensity comes from feeling that you've gone beyond the end point of a chain of absurdist logic and you really might not want to see what comes next.,Netflix,95%,83%,73

13138,Squid Game,1,The human aspect of this show shines over the morbid. For some reason we are addicted to the unmeasured violence and the isolation and behavioral analysis of human beings in movies and TV shows. Recipe for success. [Full review in Spanish],Netflix,95%,83%,73

13164,Sex/Life,0,"There is a lot of sex and a lot of nudity in Sex/Life and while Netflix probably had hoped that Sarah Shahi's presence would elevate the series, the shoddy directing and the bad writing from Stacy Rukeyser mostly drags Shahi down with it.",Netflix,22%,35%,23

13166,Sex/Life,0,"Explicitness abounds. However, the friction that Sex/Life chases more often turns into a rub. As it turns out, both good sex and a good life can bloom when fed full-throated fantasy. But for Sex/Life, its soapy sexuality washes away its potential potency.",Netflix,22%,35%,23
13167,Sex/Life,0,"Rather than interrogate why Billie's sublimated her needs for the sake of a relationship, the series seems concerned only with titillating viewers -- and, despite Shahi and Demos' athleticism and enthusiasm, even that gets old.",Netflix,22%,35%,23

13172,Sex/Life,0,"For a show about the basic instincts, it's unusually removed from anything recognizably human; for a look at what it means to heedlessly seek fulfillment, it's surprisingly sour and mean.",Netflix,22%,35%,23
13173,Sex/Life,1,"Even as I was rolling my eyes at some of the insanely stupid actions of the lead characters and chuckling at the at-times overwrought score, I can't deny ""Sex/Life"" had a certain binge-worthy quality.",Netflix,22%,35%,23

13399,Mindhunter,1,The show's second season reveals the intricate intersections between personal and political neuroses.,Netflix,97%,95%,70
13400,Mindhunter,1,"[It] isn't fixated on solving any particular cases but taking time to study the methodological eccentricity of each crime and the increasingly dark obsession of the detectives, sucked ever more inextricably into the transgressive vortex.",Netflix,97%,95%,70
13401,Mindhunter,1,"Mindhunter's second season is absorbing, upsetting, and fascinating, and it leaves us wanting more. Television can't do much better than that.",Netflix,97%,95%,70
13402,Mindhunter,1,"From the little I've seen, the high standards of season 1 haven't dipped a bit.",Netflix,97%,95%,70
13403,Mindhunter,1,"Thankfully, season 2 delivers more structure and story across nine episodes, more deeply acquainting us with the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit.",Netflix,97%,95%,70
13404,Mindhunter,1,"That Mindhunter manages to be a satisfying FBI mystery on top of that is a testament to its sharp directing and mostly smart writing, even as some threads never quite come together.",Netflix,97%,95%,70
13405,Mindhunter,1,"Mindhunter grips you -- not with the promise of some big reveal, but for what it chooses to unravel in the story of killers who've controlled their seductive narratives for far too long.",Netflix,97%,95%,70
13406,Mindhunter,1,"If you are going to spend your weekend guiltily luxuriating in a show about the depths of human depravity, you might as well make it a stylish one.",Netflix,97%,95%,70
13407,Mindhunter,1,"What's most compelling about Mindhunter is the way that, like its protagonists, it investigates the human response to violent crime and, in particular, the way that close proximity to such crime can burnish one's image.",Netflix,97%,95%,70
13408,Mindhunter,1,Mindhunter's second season embraces a world where enduring mysteries don't always have satisfying conclusions.,Netflix,97%,95%,70
13409,Mindhunter,1,"While it mostly hangs together for now, there are already more signs of strain than there were back in 2017.",Netflix,97%,95%,70
13410,Mindhunter,1,"It is effective, haunting, scary, and one of the most provocative shows ever and hands down one of the best shows of the year",Netflix,97%,95%,70
13411,Mindhunter,1,"While the series benefits from giving everyone more to do, the pacing could be quicker.",Netflix,97%,95%,70

13417,Mindhunter,1,The series feeds more on the idea that knowledge and understanding of the human condition - in all its sometimes horrific glory - is what's truly fascinating.,Netflix,97%,95%,70
13418,Mindhunter,1,"Finding a way to never show that which is supposed to be scaring us is so, so, so hard, and Mindhunter succeeds at it more often than not, usually by careful shot selection, terrific performances, and expertly calibrated dialogue.",Netflix,97%,95%,70
13419,Mindhunter,1,"While Mindhunter: Season 2 doesn't exactly race out of the gate as it builds on the foundation of Season 1, it remains a compelling and impeccably shot crime thriller.",Netflix,97%,95%,70
13420,Mindhunter,1,"""Mindhunter"" is deeper, richer, and more affecting this go round, even as it steers away from studying proven killers.",Netflix,97%,95%,70
13421,Mindhunter,1,"Mindhunter's most impressive accomplishment, though, is to weave an engrossing mystery without trivialising these real-life killers and their atrocious crimes. The series fascinates rather than unsettles.",Netflix,97%,95%,70
13422,Mindhunter,1,"Mindhunter is a series about difficult conversations - with bosses, with family members, with serial killers - and none of that would work without its impeccable ensemble.",Netflix,97%,95%,70
13423,Mindhunter,1,David Fincher's drama returns with new terrors and a greater emphasis on its central trio,Netflix,97%,95%,70

13427,Mindhunter,1,A stupendous season 2. [Full Review in Spanish],Netflix,97%,95%,70
13428,Mindhunter,1,"Maybe everything really is coming up Mindhunter. But in the dark and cruel world these characters live in, it all seems awfully convenient.",Netflix,97%,95%,70
13429,Mindhunter,1,"As with last season, David Fincher directs the first episode with his usual panache, especially during the cold open.",Netflix,97%,95%,70
13430,Mindhunter,1,"There's a recalibrating of Ford that includes panic attacks and a consequent popping of Valium, one of several character developments to remind us that Mindhunter isn't too cool for detective-show tropes.",Netflix,97%,95%,70
13431,Mindhunter,1,"The series is still far more Zodiac than Seven, but it's also more propulsive now, with no fewer than three ongoing investigations.",Netflix,97%,95%,70

13434,Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll is definitely back, entertainingly so, and serving up another wonderful on-screen matryoshka doll of life-pondering insights and time-twisting trickery for audiences to entrancingly unstack.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13435,Russian Doll,1,"It's not quite as riveting as the terrific first outing, but the trippy second season's imaginative twists and turns are sure to vibe with fans of offbeat comedy dramas.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13436,Russian Doll,1,"Natasha Lyonne is always entertaining to watch, but Russian Doll feels less special the second time around.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13437,Russian Doll,1,"The reason to watch is the rude and edgy convictions of its star, whose wisecracking, strutting Nadia is one of streaming’s greats. You probably wouldn’t want to spend any actual time with the character, but she’s fine while contained by a screen.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13438,Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll 2 jumps the shark quickly; the narrative is too different, and meanderingly self-indulgent, and the charm of the cast wears thin",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13439,Russian Doll,1,"They managed to give all the characters something to do in this new iteration, and I like the fact that it went into new territory but kept the same logical world that exists for what they set up in Season 1.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13440,Russian Doll,1,"Intelligently written and stylishly crafted, Russian Doll remains as entertaining and as mind-bending in its first season, with a voice that feels wholly its own.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13441,Russian Doll,1,"Raw, bruising, and existentially heavier than its predecessor. If the first installment felt miraculously complete, the seven new episodes feel instead like a slide down into a darker space.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13442,Russian Doll,1,"With its expanded new cast and twisting multiverse plot, Russian Doll pulls out all the stops to create a thrilling season of television.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13443,Russian Doll,1,The show is a shining example of how the sci-fi genre doesn’t have to consist of laundry lists of nonsense fake science terms and explosions; it can be used to tell thoughtful stories that speak to the roots of human nature.,Netflix,97%,79%,61
13444,Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll‘s acerbic wit, sharp writing and exploration of complex themes make it endlessly rewatchable in my book.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13445,Russian Doll,1,"Any show that finds a way to use Depeche Mode’s “Personal Jesus” not once, but twice, will make a believer out of me.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13446,Russian Doll,0,"It is an ambitious but ultimately lacking attempt at illustrating how trauma is inherited from one generation to the next, at the expense of the protagonists’ development and season one friendship.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13447,Russian Doll,1,"I never thought this season would be possible, and not only is it good but it will certainly be considered one of the best shows of 2022.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13448,Russian Doll,1,"I mean -- you could try and watch it in instalments, but the lure of binge-watching in a single session is just way too powerful to resist.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13449,Russian Doll,0,"The altered nature of Nadia and Alan’s predicament mostly just feels like, “Well, we got picked up for another season, so why not?”",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13450,Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll season two is a mind-bending, time-bending, genre-bending wonder that more than proves its right to exist.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13451,Russian Doll,1,There is still plenty to dig into.,Netflix,97%,79%,61
13452,Russian Doll,1,"Instead of feeling like a rehash, “Russian Doll” becomes even more of a funny, evocative story.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13453,Russian Doll,1,"The wider scope and deeper questions of Russian Doll’s second season thrillingly build on the first season’s foundation, and bring the viewer along for an extremely satisfying ride.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13454,Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll manages to pack in big laughs, real emotional moments, and an effective time-traveling plot that fits right in with what happened during the show’s trippy first season.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13455,Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll is still the Russian Doll we know and love. Its humor, its darkness, its curiosity in the history of the self in the context of greater history let it stand apart in the television landscape.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13456,Russian Doll,1,"This new season is less a Russian doll than a Fabergé egg. Gilded, ornate, almost ostentatiously clever and beguiling, but with that crucial surprise -- a nugget of emotional clarity -- that emerges as the egg is cracked.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13457,Russian Doll,1,"If Russian Doll were a place, it would be less like the grid plan of Manhattan and more like the incoherence of Boston. But Ms. Lyonne is certainly an entertaining tour guide.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13458,Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll's second season finds a way to keep the feistiness of time trickery alive with a Quantum Leap-style story that, of course, leads to wonderfully tender and meaningful catharsis.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13459,Russian Doll,1,"Its all about discovery with Russian Doll, they do not hide the festering wound of the human spirit.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13460,Russian Doll,1,"While fascinating, the sophomore season doesn’t quite have the magic of the zeitgeist-capturing first season.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13461,Russian Doll,1,"""Doll"" didn't really need to come back, but Lyonne and the writers found a way to advance the story without ruining it.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13462,Russian Doll,1,"“Russian Doll” turns somersaults to get where it’s going, but its conclusions are emotionally unambiguous and universally useful and consonant with the previous season’s themes of attachment and surrender.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13463,Russian Doll,1,"After the first series achieved that rarest of feats — a truly neat and satisfying ending — this largely enjoyable new instalment feels just a little more jumbled, and a little less than necessary.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13464,Russian Doll,1,"It dares to ask big questions about trauma, grief and fate. If that doesn’t sound amusing, well, it still manages to be.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13465,Russian Doll,1,Lyonne reveals the exhaustion and exhilaration of carrying so many multitudes within. She makes complexity look easy.,Netflix,97%,79%,61
13466,Russian Doll,1,"It was always going to be difficult for any follow-up to have the same impact given that first season was so snappy and smart, but even a dimmed second season is better than 95 per cent of what you find on any streaming platform.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13467,Russian Doll,1,"I liked it more than the first season and, perhaps because I was able to identify more with some themes than in the first, I couldn't stop watching it until the end. Highly recommended. Full review in Spanish",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13468,Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll is delightful, dense, and thought-provoking.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13469,Russian Doll,1,"The show’s new season with Natasha Lyonne at the helm is more honest, more experimental, and more reflective of its maker.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13470,Russian Doll,1,"Multiverses and diverging timelines are everywhere in movies and TV lately, but as with the first season, Russian Doll confidently forges its own path.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13471,Russian Doll,1,"In its second season, iRussian Dolli continues to straddle the line between realist tragicomedy and run-of-the-mill sci-fi.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13472,Russian Doll,1,"Under its trippy surface, the story is anchored by humanity.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13473,Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll is intriguing and unpredictable, with its own distinct edge. It may not have needed a sequel, but it makes for a comforting return to a whacky pre-Covid 19 world.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13474,Russian Doll,1,"While it may not live up to the tightly-wound brilliance of its freshman season, there’s still a lot to love.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13475,Russian Doll,1,"That first season set a very high bar, so even though season two can easily be classified as a disappointment, there is still much to delight in.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13476,Russian Doll,1,"A very worthy follow-up, finding a new time-tripping premise that recaptures the sci-fi fun of Season 1. Most importantly, though, it serves as a fantastic showcase for Lyonne.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13477,Russian Doll,1,"Nadia’s wit and fabulous hair remain firmly intact, and it is satisfying to see the lovable, imperfect protagonist on the small screen again.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13478,Russian Doll,1,"This season is more like Back to the Future crossed with Quantum Leap. It’s a messier fantasy than the perfectly contained first season, but still smart and absorbing -- a head trip well worth taking.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13479,Russian Doll,1,"""Russian Doll"" season 2 is messy and complicated, but ultimately emotionally enlightening  just like the trauma therapy it represents.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13480,Russian Doll,1,"As season 2 nears its end, it progressively becomes more metaphorical, embracing its science-fiction credentials with much gusto, all the while showcasing the inherent humor embedded in each of its scenes.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13481,Russian Doll,1,"An absorbing lead performance from Natasha Lyonne is the guiding light of the shows success, and the actress continues to bring the same charisma she initially infused into the role.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13482,Russian Doll,1,"This time travel story is more traditional and a little less fun than last season’s perpetual weird night out, but it’s still a treat to spend time with one of modern television’s most interesting characters.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13483,Russian Doll,1,"A relatively quick viewing experience and, for the most part, a distinct successor to 2019’s original run... But Season 2 ultimately suffers from a lack of momentum and misguided assembly.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13484,Russian Doll,1,"With its second season, Russian Doll crafts a narrative that is far more confounding and less structured than the first, and while it might not always work, the result is a season that is far more layered, emotionally satisfying, and engrossing...",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13485,Russian Doll,1,"Between Lyonne's performance and many moments of interdimensional claustrophobia, it effectively plays into the strengths of the first season without simply repeating them.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13486,Russian Doll,1,"Its exploration of how fruitless ""what if"" thinking is and the importance of taking agency in your own life despite your generational baggage builds wonderfully on the themes explored in the first season.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13487,Russian Doll,1,"Season Two is no lazy rehash. The tone is similar, even though the story and sci-fi gimmick are different. In many ways, it’s more audacious in scope and themes.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13488,Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll Season 2 is good, but it’s not quite as great as Russian Doll Season 1.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13489,Russian Doll,1,"For the most part, while the experimental aspects of this season didn’t fully work, I do think the risks are worth taking. More TV should be weirder!",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13490,Russian Doll,1,"After too long away, Netflix subscribers are in for a treat as they unpack Russian Doll once again.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13491,Russian Doll,1,"Stepping to the forefront of the show’s creative team, Natasha Lyonne has delivered seven episodes that are more personal and take bigger intellectual risks than anything in the initial run.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13492,Russian Doll,1,Nadia and the show both allow themselves to get messier than either might’ve thought possible after Season 1’s conclusion.,Netflix,97%,79%,61
13493,Russian Doll,1,"It reinvents its protagonists and its mythology, using the duo’s complex ancestry as a gut punch to further develop them.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13494,Russian Doll,1,"Time travel was a clever way to keep Russian Doll Season 2 in the same milieu, while trying something different. Season 3 will have to go into the future or into space to really explore everything science fiction has to offer.",Netflix,97%,79%,61
13495,Sex Education,1,"Arguably the jewel in Netflix's queer representation crown, Sex Education, does not get enough credit for how well-crafted, well-written, and caring it is when it comes to attention to stories of teen sexual identity and orientation.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13496,Sex Education,1,"No one series can undo generations of stereotypes and blind spots within the coming-of-age sub-genre, but that wont stop Sex Education from trying.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13497,Sex Education,1,"We've long ignored great performances in teen-centric series. So it's a shame that Asa Butterfield, Ncuti Gatwa, Emma Mackey, and Gillian Anderson in the performance that she should have won the Emmy for (not The Crown), keep being passed over.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13498,Sex Education,1,A show that explores its subjects far beyond the surface level. [Full review in Spanish],Netflix,95%,92%,39
13499,Sex Education,1,"Sex Education keeps getting better because it approaches storytelling the way it teaches us to approach sex - with curiosity, excitement, and a willingness to learn.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13500,Sex Education,1,"This colourful, honest and non-judgmental series doesn't treat sex with kid gloves or mince words with euphemisms.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13501,Sex Education,0,"For the first time, Sex Education seems to be trying to figure out what type of show it wants to be.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13502,Sex Education,1,"Season 3 sheds more light on [Jean's] views on motherhood, independence, and her fears. If Eric is the heart of the series, Jean is the architect behind everyone's emotional journey.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13503,Sex Education,1,I was completely blown away by how much this show has changed from its very first episode. This is the best show on Netflix right now.,Netflix,95%,92%,39
13504,Sex Education,1,"Sex Education's third season is, frankly, great, with strong writing, direction, and performances. It's a must see.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13505,Sex Education,1,"All the young actors shine, but none of them more than Ncuti Gatwa, who plays Eric with an energy and resilience that is inspiring to watch. This season, Gatwa isn't just a joy; he brings more nuance and authenticity than ever.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13506,Sex Education,1,"This season is entertainment in its purest form. It is raw, unafraid, and brilliant with how it handles its characters.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13507,Sex Education,1,"The show has trouble maintaining the sheer volume of story involving so many characters, and unfortunately, any single review of the season simply cannot cover it all. Every plot is worth taking a look at, though.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13508,Sex Education,1,No show currently on TV is as progressive as Sex Education. That makes it a gem.,Netflix,95%,92%,39
13509,Sex Education,1,"Sex Education season 3 is full of fan service for the devoted viewer - but it's to its credit as well as its detriment. They're pushing their limits, but Sex Education provides a world that lets them get away with it.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13510,Sex Education,1,"Sex Education returns with another wonderfully raunchy and riotous season filled with lovable characters and insightful inclusion. Like the character of Otis, the show is hopped up on hormones and surprisingly wise about it.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13511,Sex Education,1,"Every show covets the kind of character development and narrative strength on display here, and Sex Education makes it look easy.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13512,Sex Education,1,"The drama that springs between characters isn't as earthshaking as the drama rising at Moordale, and this may be ""Sex Education""s most important detail. Relationships will always, always meet conflict",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13513,Sex Education,1,A sub-par Sex Education is still a good and joyful thing.,Netflix,95%,92%,39
13514,Sex Education,1,In Season 3 Lily is not just a joke; she's simply a person who can't help being herself. Reynolds has previously been a strong comedic player but here she finally gets to show her capability for dramatic depth.,Netflix,95%,92%,39
13515,Sex Education,1,Sex Education season three really is the binge-watch you've been waiting for.,Netflix,95%,92%,39
13516,Sex Education,1,"The magic of the show remains that nothing 'heavy' ever feels hectoring, tokenising or clumsy. In fact, the lightness of touch does it all.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13517,Sex Education,1,"This time ahead of season three can instead be used to highlight a poignant message regarding the importance of individuality, uniqueness and embracing one's identity.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13518,Sex Education,1,"Sex Education, once again, masters the difficult undertaking of being both entertaining and enlightening.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13519,Sex Education,1,"The show remains comical, relevant, and fun.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13520,Sex Education,1,"What holds it all together is a real sense that as funny as all this is to the observer, when you're at that age, in that place, it all feels titanically important.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13521,Sex Education,1,"On the whole, it's a very satisfying bounce-back year that suggests Sex Education would still have stories to tell in a fourth (and, given the characters' ages, presumably final) season.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13522,Sex Education,1,"Quietly subversive, proudly progressive, and blessed with a delicate, empathic tone; Netflix's deceptively titled show remains wildly stimulating.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13523,Sex Education,1,"As we reach the third season, it's time to say that Sex Education has passed the test. It hasn't befallen to third season syndrome, and it's kept the story consistent and informative.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13524,Sex Education,1,"Yet another hilarious, heartfelt and deeply honest season for the Netflix gem.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13525,Sex Education,1,What makes Sex Education stand out from the crowded genre of high school content is how it's not afraid to address things that others skate over.,Netflix,95%,92%,39
13526,Sex Education,1,"In its third outing, the series remains cringingly honest and engagingly heartfelt, with just the right amount of pathos and the occasional outrageous sight gag.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13527,Sex Education,1,"The show once again does an excellent job of showcasing its lesser-seen, supporting characters, who are still in need of sex advice, particularly with Otis and Maeve now retired from their clinic side-hustle.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13528,Sex Education,1,"It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and even after eight (almost) hour-long episodes, it'll somehow still leave you wanting more.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13529,Sex Education,1,"It continuously seeks out subjects and identities that have been marginalised or stigmatised, and finds new ways to work them into a comedy framework without sacrificing heart and integrity.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13530,Sex Education,1,"Sex Education retains its inherent sweetness and relatability, fleshing out its protagonists' backstories and friendships without seeming overstuffed or superficial.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13531,Sex Education,1,"Sex Education season 3 proves the show is just as fun as ever with belly laughs and emotional moments in spades, even if some elements are a little too one dimensional and has the potential to frustrate.",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13532,Sex Education,1,...quite possibly the best season of Sex Education so far.,Netflix,95%,92%,39
13533,Sex Education,1,"Season 3 has been a long time coming, but it's absolutely worth the wait, so strap in and enjoy the ride!",Netflix,95%,92%,39
13534,Love & Anarchy,1,"Love & Anarchy takes the formula it established in its first season and shakes it up, sending the show in an interesting new direction that keeps the spirit of its first season intact.",Netflix,100%,82%,1
13535,Black Summer,1,"It is intense, and certainly not a show for everyone. For those who like their zombie shows pure, uncut, and undiluted, however, Black Summer continues to do the trick in season two.",Netflix,89%,61%,8
13536,Black Summer,1,"More accomplished and more confident, Black Summer ends with enough mysteries and unanswered questions to merit a third season.",Netflix,89%,61%,8
13537,Black Summer,1,"The randomness of their deaths, and knowing that anyone could go at any time, is a huge part of Black Summer's appeal. But because it's so relentless, character beats are few and far between, which also means you end up caring about them far less too.",Netflix,89%,61%,8
13538,Black Summer,1,"Black Summer is currently one of the best zombie entries across media in season 2 here, and a picture of what The Walking Dead has lost over the years, and something it can probably never reach, given the formula it's now locked into.",Netflix,89%,61%,8

13555,Bridgerton,1,"They seemed to have a very clear idea of what the main three players needed to be, but maybe felt a draft or two away from smoothly transitioning those stories between the polite societal standards and volatile horniness they all engage in.",Netflix,82%,76%,86
13556,Bridgerton,1,Many of the main characters’ faces are now a little too familiar; some of the charm (and the sex) of the first installment are gone. But it’s still a comfy watch for the undemanding.,Netflix,82%,76%,86
13557,Bridgerton,0,"Even at its best, Bridgerton was never high-minded in what it had to offer, but at least it was a harmlessly salacious good time. Now that’s gone, the period drama is little more than a glass of champagne carelessly left out all night.",Netflix,82%,76%,86
13558,Bridgerton,1,Season two arrives keeping the soapiness intact while surprisingly toning down the saucier material.,Netflix,82%,76%,86
13559,Bridgerton,1,"The new season of the Netflix smash hit may not be as physical, but in the crackling chemistry and relentless self-denial that defines the leads’ dynamic, there’s plenty of eroticism.",Netflix,82%,76%,86
13560,Bridgerton,1,"While Anthony and Kates story isnt quite the bodice-ripper that its predecessor was, its still plenty watchable. Bridgerton may not be on fire this season, but its still got its spark.",Netflix,82%,76%,86
13561,Bridgerton,1,"Bridgerton 2 is all fine escapist fun, and it’s probably more tightly-written than the first series, but its revised format lacks the shock-and-awe impact of its predecessor.",Netflix,82%,76%,86

13571,Bridgerton,1,"The sophomore outing of Bridgerton is just as delightful as its first, even if it’s much safer. The Shondaland-produced series is still an effortlessly binge-able, dreamy fantasy of a diverse and passionate Regency-era London.",Netflix,82%,76%,86

13579,Bridgerton,1,"Take my word, dear reader, this second helping of the smash Netflix series still smolders. Despite  a drag at midpoint and the no-show of season-one sex magnet Regé-Jean Page, the dishy cosplay brims over with eye-popping spectacle and ravishing romance.",Netflix,82%,76%,86

13582,Bridgerton,1,"While the privileged atmosphere, back-stabbing, rampant rutting and frocks are certainly part of the Bridgerton allure, so is the refreshing acknowledgment of how dumb it all is. Even the carriage horses seem to be in on the joke.",Netflix,82%,76%,86

13584,Bridgerton,1,"Bridgerton remains gorgeously frothy, deeply silly and highly watchable - its legions of fans will eat this up. The honeymoon period might be over, but this romance looks like it will go the distance.",Netflix,82%,76%,86
13585,Bridgerton,1,"Where the first season of the show was compelling because it's groundbreaking in so many ways, its romance between two beautiful people who have the hots for each other pales in comparison to the barbed sexual tension between Season 2's leads.",Netflix,82%,76%,86
13586,Bridgerton,1,"Bridgerton is still a great show and is worth the watch, but for me, I just didn’t feel the burn this time around.",Netflix,82%,76%,86

13606,Bridgerton,1,"Bridgerton Season 2 is still really enjoyable television and there’s a lot to like here... The end result is something that is, on all accounts, honestly mostly fine, but that is ultimately tarnished by the memory of how good what came before it was.",Netflix,82%,76%,86
13607,Bridgerton,1,"It may falter a little in one of its subplots, but the developments within the Bridgerton family, the central romance, and the saga of Lady Whistledown ensure that this follow-up is far from a disappointment.",Netflix,82%,76%,86
13608,Bridgerton,1,"While its not as raunchy as the first season, in many ways this season is more romantic and I dont think the returning audience (unless theyre maybe die-hard fans of the books) will be disappointed. Bailey is outstanding, as are the costumes.",Netflix,82%,76%,86

13632,Inventing Anna,0,"On screen, the story is neither salacious enough nor studied enough to bring about any concrete conclusions. Instead, it falls into its own obsessive rabbit hole, and we dont feel inclined to follow.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13633,Inventing Anna,1,"Ultimately, viewers are left with a captivating story about a Gen-Zer who almost girlbossed her way to the top. The series could have greatly benefited from a tighter narrative, providing an insiders look at the modern jet set",Netflix,64%,35%,85

13638,Inventing Anna,1,"It takes very real people, inspires a few fictional characters and fully runs with it.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13639,Inventing Anna,0,"In trying to make the show about gossip and the media, Inventing Anna actually misses whatever it is that Anna herself was up to and rather focused on what she thought she was doing. Instead of adding complexity, it just comes off as muddled.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13640,Inventing Anna,1,"Even when Inventing Anna comes off as vapid as its main character, it’s worth checking out purely for how much it revels in overindulgence. There’s more than enough to fill you up.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13641,Inventing Anna,0,"The show certainly provides indulgence (if maybe not enough for my taste). Its failure is in the framing of Delvey’s story: It’s depicted as a quasi-feminist, girlboss-adjacent revenge fantasy.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13642,Inventing Anna,1,Inventing Anna is one of the best new series of 2022. Its a grimy and uncomfortable con-story that keeps you guessing until the end.,Netflix,64%,35%,85

13648,Inventing Anna,1,Julia Garner is the Meryl Streep of our generation.,Netflix,64%,35%,85
13649,Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna’s chronic inability to get to the point is reflected in its sprawling nine-episode length, each one lasting an hour or more, not least because the show keeps recycling its own flashbacks as if poking us to stay awake.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13650,Inventing Anna,1,"Garner’s performance (and accent) are as electric as one would expect here, and it’s a real treat to watch her go.",Netflix,64%,35%,85

13652,Inventing Anna,1,"The true story it's based on is fascinatingly bizarre, and so is this series stocked with sublime actors, but using the journalist who broke Sorokin's tale as an entry point was a tactical error.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13653,Inventing Anna,1,"Garner fully commits to the role without missing its comedic beats. She seems to both be steeped in Anna’s world and ironically to the side of it -- in a series that is often flattened by its formal mediocrity, hers is an excellent performance.",Netflix,64%,35%,85

13655,Inventing Anna,1,“Inventing Anna” isn’t a tough watch. The actors do a lot to compensate for what’s missing.,Netflix,64%,35%,85
13656,Inventing Anna,1,"This might not be the Anna Delvey drama we expected. Its more trash than grit, though undeniably enjoyable. Once you try to take it as seriously as her crimes, its hard to see Inventing Anna as anything other than a very expensive PR campaign.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13657,Inventing Anna,1,"If youre looking for an in-depth analytical exploration into her behaviour, this wont be the Netflix drama for you. If youre looking for a Real Housewives meet Gossip Girl drama about scamming the snobby wealthy of New York, youre in for a treat.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13658,Inventing Anna,0,The result falls flat. Inventing Anna is a stretched-out nine-episode romp that never quite catches the enigma of its protagonist -- or matches her appeal.,Netflix,64%,35%,85

13665,Inventing Anna,1,"Thoroughly entertaining thanks to a wealth of Manhattan elites who fell for Delvey’s schtick, Inventing Anna proves an addictive, who-is-she? riff on the whodunit.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13666,Inventing Anna,1,"Even with an occasionally clunky script, Inventing Anna is ridiculously watchable, aided in part by another scene-stealing performance from Julia Garner and a top-notch ensemble.",Netflix,64%,35%,85

13680,Inventing Anna,1,"It may have more heft than it initially appears, but it is played essentially as a modern soap opera – and God, is it fun.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13681,Inventing Anna,1,"A Binge-worthy series you will find once it has you, you too will be under Annas spell.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13682,Inventing Anna,0,"While it may tell Annas story, it does so in the most basic, bare-bones manner, devoid of any real personality, fire, or even genuinely compelling characters  thanks mostly in part to the shows (sometimes painfully) lackluster scripts.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13683,Inventing Anna,1,"Garner is, not surprisingly, fully up to the difficult task of portraying a person with no center, both for laughs and for drama. She is compelling throughout.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13684,Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna is a meandering and shallow take on Anna Sorokin's story, glacially paced with superfluous tangents that distract from the character we're really interested in.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13685,Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna careens all over the place, and one of its only consistencies is an exhausting insistence that Delvey was talented but misunderstood.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13686,Inventing Anna,0,"It’s a Sisyphean task to get us to care as much about the writing of an article as the escapades of the person being written about, and neither the series nor a surprisingly depthless Chlumsky succeeds in doing so.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13687,Inventing Anna,1,"The series lacks a clear focus and has an inconsistent tone. Overall, I was rather disappointed, but the premise and a few standout performances make the series worth watching.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13688,Inventing Anna,0,This bloated true-crime drama from Shonda Rhimes alternately seeks to scold and celebrate New York con artist Anna Delvey (Julia Garner) and the relentless reporter (Anna Chlumsky) who brought her story to light.,Netflix,64%,35%,85
13689,Inventing Anna,0,"By the end, Inventing Anna may test your resolve as you decide how much time you choose to spend in the company of an unrepentant bossy narcissist, regardless of how well she’s played.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13690,Inventing Anna,1,Shonda Rhimess first limited series for Netflix is a win for both her and the streamer. The series boasts an outstanding lead performance from Julia Garner as well as good to great performances from the entire supporting cast.,Netflix,64%,35%,85
13691,Inventing Anna,1,"Imagine a stitch, combining the investigative style of Law & Order with everything intrinsic to a Shondaland series, including the pivoting plotlines, messy humanity, and the nearly diabolical (its so clever) dialogue.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13692,Inventing Anna,1,"Like too many streaming series, it trades in efficiency and force for length and reduced churn. Still, there’s a lot to chew on, including a handful of delicacies yet to be so earnestly unearthed in all those other stories of the rich and famous.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13693,Inventing Anna,1,Inventing Anna is the perfect Shondaland series in that it is incredibly fun to watch but filled with issues.,Netflix,64%,35%,85
13694,Inventing Anna,1,"The modesty of its thematic and narrative ambitions keep Inventing Anna from being a great show. It could have been truly great if it had decided to really be about something, but instead it's content to just be fun.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13695,Inventing Anna,1,"Even if I was hooked by Anna's story of artistry and deceit, I felt Shonda Rhimes new proposal could have used less runtime.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13696,Inventing Anna,1,The series suffers from a few meandering detours but succeeds in its goal of elevating its central figure.,Netflix,64%,35%,85
13697,Inventing Anna,1,"A show all about superficial pizzazz, in which flashy aesthetics ripped from reality TV arent just surface texture. They're text and subtext too, appearing each time someone recalls when they were first lured in by Delvey's mysterious charm.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13698,Inventing Anna,1,"The plot of Inventing Anna can feel a bit convoluted at times, but all the various jigsaw pieces of the story come together in a satisfying way by the end, albeit some more interesting and outrageous than others.",Netflix,64%,35%,85

13701,Inventing Anna,0,Inventing Anna feels like a ghost of a shadow of its central narrative. What’s left is a show that is so obsessed with the idea of its main character that it forgets to explore who that young woman is.,Netflix,64%,35%,85
13702,Inventing Anna,1,Part of the perversely entertaining allure of both Delvey and the series is being able to admire her epic gall while also being glad you’re not her.,Netflix,64%,35%,85
13703,Inventing Anna,0,"It’s an overly long muddle, never quite sure what it wants to say about its title character, or how to say it.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13704,Inventing Anna,1,"At once, it manages to be a largely gripping recounting of the original scam, that will satisfy anyone who eagerly lapped up Pressler's feature, and a sophisticated dissection of a postmodern media event.",Netflix,64%,35%,85

13707,Inventing Anna,1,Watch enough of the series and she’ll infect your brain; you’ll start reading sentences to yourself in Anna’s voice. You’ll get as obsessed with her as Vivian and those who knew Anna do.,Netflix,64%,35%,85
13708,Inventing Anna,0,"It’s too much that adds to too little. There is a compelling story to tell here, but “Inventing Anna” isn’t it.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13709,Inventing Anna,1,"The results are occasionally messy and often unwieldy — most of its nine episodes clock in at over an hour each  — but they’re also savvy, sly and compulsively watchable.",Netflix,64%,35%,85
13710,Inventing Anna,1,"Even as the show around her stutters, Garner leans into her role with a vulpine, barely there grin that proves irresistible.",Netflix,64%,35%,85

13712,Inventing Anna,1,"A juicy, messy, series that is jam packed with drama, betrayal, manipulation, twists, turns, and surprises. One of those shows that will have viewers creating their own timelines and taking notes  doing everything they can to piece it all together.",Netflix,64%,35%,85

13715,The Pentaverate,1,"The Pentaverate is a funny satire of secret societies and conspiracies [...] and a great return to form for Mike Myers who plays 8 characters, all with moments to shine, and never overpowering. Lydia West expresses wonderful comedic talent every episode.",Netflix,28%,62%,25
13716,The Pentaverate,0,Mike Myers' affectionate but uneven conspiracy theory comedy is let down by its lowbrow humour.,Netflix,28%,62%,25
13717,The Pentaverate,1,"The story is involved, but the plot is episodic and the comedy mostly genial, with puns, excessive accents and bodily function gags (lots of those). It’s nice to have Myers back, but this is at best a distraction.",Netflix,28%,62%,25

13725,The Pentaverate,0,"If you're not bowled over by the eight rubbery faces Myers cycle through its six episodes, maybe it's because they're only slightly removed from versions of his characters you've laughed with before but whose humor feels crustily outdated in 2022.",Netflix,28%,62%,25
13726,The Pentaverate,0,"There are rare parts of The Pentaverate that demonstrate how Mike Myers' brand of humor can still feel fun and fresh here in 2022, but too much of it proves the opposite.",Netflix,28%,62%,25

13731,The Pentaverate,0,"Underneath its mildly amusing, emotionally scattered exterior, The Pentaverate is a flawed but heartfelt ode to the importance of honesty in an era where lies are widespread and popularized.",Netflix,28%,62%,25
13732,The Pentaverate,0,"That the resulting show isn’t good doesn’t especially matter, in the end. It’ll probably still find enough curious viewers to justify the partnership, and for Netflix, that’ll be more than enough.",Netflix,28%,62%,25

13734,The Pentaverate,0,"We don’t expect The Pentaverate to get much funnier as the season goes along. And the longer we watch, we think the more painfully unfunny most of the gags are going to get.",Netflix,28%,62%,25
13735,The Pentaverate,1,"This is a Myers show, and it offers all the comfort and eye-rolling fatigue you’d expect from that, regardless of what year it is. That’s the resilience of juvenile humor: It never ages.",Netflix,28%,62%,25

13740,Outer Banks,1,"The way it's all packaged together, however, makes it slick enough that it's irresistible to all ages. Don't feel guilty if you feel a little too old for this show before you begin, because that bonkers mystery will keep you clicking.",Netflix,78%,79%,7
13741,Outer Banks,1,"Maybe it's a show that's still trying too hard at points, but it's easy to imagine that fans of ""Outer Banks"" watching Season 2 will find much of what they're searching for.",Netflix,78%,79%,7

13745,Outer Banks,1,"The real draw of Outer Banks is its sense of fun and outlandish adventure-like an older Goonies with more death-defying stakes attached. As someone once said, stupid things have positive outcomes all the time.",Netflix,78%,79%,7

13763,Behind Her Eyes,1,"I admire, for its sheer, nasty audacity, the double twist that ends the story. To achieve its impact, though, the limited series requires you not merely to suspend your disbelief, but strap it to a rocket and send it to the Milky Way.",Netflix,62%,57%,37

13780,Behind Her Eyes,0,"Here's my general opinion: I like a good twist, but the twist in Behind Her Eyes is a groaner. The series switches genres, and the final chapter felt to me like a slap in the face -- when it didn't make me laugh out loud at the absurdity.",Netflix,62%,57%,37

14094,Shadow and Bone,1,"A sprawling adaptation of Leigh Bardugo's first Grishaverse novel, Shadow and Bone needlessly complicates matters by including fan favourite characters from Six of Crows. Takes a while to settle in, but overall this is compelling stuff",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14095,Shadow and Bone,1,"It doesn't feel like it's dumbed down for television audience which is nice BUT it is a bit difficult to keep up with if you have never before heard of the ""Grishaverse"" (raises hand) because you practically need a glossary of characters.",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14096,Shadow and Bone,1,Shadow and Bone succeeds where so many fantasy adaptations fail if you stay with it and understand that it requires a bit of patience. It takes inventive writing and great acting to really bring a world to life like this.,Netflix,88%,88%,77

14100,Shadow and Bone,1,"Vitally for a genre series in a time when we're all pretty much over grim dystopias, the show has a human heart, a rollicking pace, and an honest-to-god sense of humor.",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14101,Shadow and Bone,1,"The mold is not broken with Shadow and Bone, but there is a lot of refinement... All in all, the characters hold up, are nuanced, and have decent arcs that dip in and out of the heroes' journey.",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14102,Shadow and Bone,1,It was absolutely incredible to see these unforgettable characters come to life.,Netflix,88%,88%,77
14103,Shadow and Bone,1,"The fantastic elements of the series are quite imaginative and ingenious, and the construction of the universe is very detailed. [Full review in Spanish]",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14104,Shadow and Bone,1,"The various details and peculiarities we find in the story make this series something exceptional, at least in its first season. [Full review in Spanish]",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14105,Shadow and Bone,0,The storytelling in this adaptation from showrunner Eric Heisserer (Bird Box. Arrival) fails to establish and maintain a momentum nearly as powerful as some of the show's magic.,Netflix,88%,88%,77

14109,Shadow and Bone,1,"...there are great characters, insurmountable odds, and a winning sense of humor. The writing, as Eric Heisserer is known for, is well composed, taut, and exciting--all fueled by relatable emotion. My anticipation for season 2 is real.",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14110,Shadow and Bone,1,"Perfectly competent, enjoyable stuff. But, like The Witcher and the other contenders for the Thrones' crown that there have been since, it doesn't - or can't, whether for merely budgetary or more creative constraints - build on what has gone before.",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14111,Shadow and Bone,1,It's strange: You almost want Alina to take a back step and let the darker side characters shine. Yet it's thanks to their wild card additions that Shadow and Bone stands apart from the packed ranks of young adult viewing.,Netflix,88%,88%,77
14112,Shadow and Bone,1,Loved getting swept into the world of Shadow and Bone for 8 hours and I would watch it again in a heartbeat!,Netflix,88%,88%,77

14114,Shadow and Bone,1,"Stunningly gorgeous and mesmerizing, this enchanting series is the rightful heir to the Game of Thrones throne, and solid proof that TV adaptations can improve on their source material.",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14115,Shadow and Bone,1,"""Shadow and Bone"" is engaging as a story, but it's a fantastic experience in terms of its texture. You do not simply watch this series, you enter it.",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14116,Shadow and Bone,1,"If Shadow and Bone doesn't provide quite the level of characterizing nuance and challenging chronological complexity of The Witcher - and it does not - it does go down easier, and seems expressly intended to make long weekend afternoons pass more quickly.",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14117,Shadow and Bone,0,"Again and again, Shadow and Bone forces unearned story beats and melodrama. Its character-building is lackluster; its worldbuilding is mostly incoherent, and its script careens from one-liner to one-liner without much substance in between.",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14118,Shadow and Bone,0,Shadow and Bone could use some intimacy! Its conflicts as currently written are way too big and too abstract; its characters are too generic and undefined.,Netflix,88%,88%,77

14120,Shadow and Bone,1,"Some may look at this as counting appearances instead of measuring performances, but all of these actors enliven the script with their portrayals; Young and Suman in particular make Shadow and Bone worth watching.",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14121,Shadow and Bone,0,"The show's political intrigue comes off as boilerplate, but the thrust of the source material's narrative remains largely unchanged.",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14122,Shadow and Bone,1,"Shadow And Bone is predictable. It checks all the overly familiar boxes when it comes to fantasy stories like these. But it still feels epic, and the interesting characters make up for the paint by the numbers plotting.",Netflix,88%,88%,77

14126,Shadow and Bone,1,The first episode of Shadow And Bone gives every indication that it's going to be a successful fantasy franchise for Netflix.,Netflix,88%,88%,77
14127,Shadow and Bone,1,"That the casting is so intuitive and flawless is part of why the show will be a hit. Fans can fall in love with Li and Barnes and Renaux, but also the minor characters, who deserve at least as much attention.",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14128,Shadow and Bone,0,Shadow and Bone is merely the latest reasonably handsome streaming series whose aspirations beyond qualifying as a mild diversion turn out to be mostly smoke and mirrors.,Netflix,88%,88%,77

14131,Shadow and Bone,1,"It's all very handsomely made, though the early episodes have a kind of young-adult vibe that isn't down to the youth of Alina and her pals. Worth a look.",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14132,Shadow and Bone,1,"Unlike its predecessors on film, this Netflix adaptation sets about improving on the source material's tired, sexist clichés at every turn, creating a lead character worthy of her own adventure series.",Netflix,88%,88%,77

14143,Shadow and Bone,1,"Will say this for Shadow And Bone: every damn penny of its massive Netflix budget is right up on the screen, though it's often difficult to appreciate the detail in the sets and costumes because the show is darker than that last battle in Game Of Thrones.",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14144,Shadow and Bone,1,"It's a beautifully made show, with the best visual touch beyond the effects being the costumes designed by Wendy Partridge, which lean heavily on Russian influences to make this world feel distinct and special from other fantasy tales.",Netflix,88%,88%,77

14149,Shadow and Bone,1,"You can watch the first season for the twisty world-building, Wendy Partridge's lovely costumes, several enjoyable performances and the comfort of its reliable YA plotting. Just don't expect to immediately understand everything.",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14150,Shadow and Bone,1,Shadow and Bone is good clean fun with a vengeance.,Netflix,88%,88%,77

14154,Shadow and Bone,1,"The driving engine of the show is Alina, a challenge Li embraces... Li makes for a compelling center of gravity. Her Alina is smart and loyal, annoyed and rash, heartbroken and headstrong.",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14155,Shadow and Bone,1,"Shadow and Bone works well as an adaptation because it not only recounts the events of the first book in the first Grishaverse trilogy, it expands on them, integrating new stories into the fold.",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14156,Shadow and Bone,1,"There are quite a few plotlines to balance, which isn't unheard of for fantasy stories, but it does mean this one season has to run through quite a bit of character introduction in order to tie it all together.",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14157,Shadow and Bone,1,"A refreshing new world...complex, charismatic, and so much fun.",Netflix,88%,88%,77
14158,Shadow and Bone,1,"It's worth watching, especially for the lesser-known Kit Young, Amita Suman and Danielle Galligan, as well as bigger name Ben Barnes. Once the clunky exposition gets out of the way, you can start to enjoy discovering the world you're in.",Netflix,88%,88%,77

14172,Unbelievable,1,"You know the saying that the truth is always worse than anything we could imagine or come up with. Well, this Netflix limited series is an example of that.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14173,Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable unfolds slowly and methodically and without melodrama. Its eight episodes take the time to show the cost of sexual assault on its victims, and its deliberateness heightens the ironic sting of the series' title.",Netflix,98%,89%,84

14179,Unbelievable,1,"It's a powerful, impactful show that will stay with you for a long time. An unflinching look at justice, inequality, and the fantasy of a perfect victim.",Netflix,98%,89%,84

14185,Unbelievable,1,"In lesser hands Unbelievable might slowly unravel, but in the hands of writers Susannah Grant, Michael Chabon and Ayelet Waldman, and director Lisa Cholodenko, it gets more riveting by the second.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14186,Unbelievable,1,"As a true crime miniseries, Unbelievable does well in telling the womens' side of things, depicting their trauma, and how they are forced to relive the horrific events over and over.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14187,Unbelievable,1,One of Unbelievable's strongest elements is the relationship between these two women - enhanced by the actors' skill in creating a prickly relationship between two strong personalities.,Netflix,98%,89%,84
14188,Unbelievable,1,"This story about the pursuit of a serial rapist in California could have been lurid or tacky, but instead it's commendably thoughtful and spends almost all its time on the victims and their struggle to be believed.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14189,Unbelievable,1,"On Unbelievable, we really see a difference between what happens to survivors who are believed and the ones who are written off from the start.",Netflix,98%,89%,84

14200,Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable might be the first cop show to focus not on how ""impartial objectivity"" is the only way to handle an investigation, but how much that objectivity can actually f*ck it.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14201,Unbelievable,1,It makes great television.,Netflix,98%,89%,84
14202,Unbelievable,1,That is precisely the narrative decision that the series creators have taken: what matters is the word. [Full Review in Spanish],Netflix,98%,89%,84

14207,Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable isn't light viewing. But in defending reality against received wisdom and eschewing suspense in favor of insight, it makes a plea for revising simplistic rape narratives.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14208,Unbelievable,1,"This is a faithful adaptation that plainly lays out the victims' stories and lets the audience see for themselves how differently they were treated, down to every question.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14209,Unbelievable,1,Unbelievable does what very few shows centred around sexual assault have managed to do: It debunks the black and white narratives of the social and systemic politics of rape.,Netflix,98%,89%,84
14210,Unbelievable,1,Unbelievable needs to be excruciating and infuriating but also watchable. And the platform where it airs might be the only place where it can accomplish that goal.,Netflix,98%,89%,84

14231,Unbelievable,1,"The most standout aspect of Unbelievable, though, is that it shines light on survivors and heroes, rather than dwelling upon the psyches of perpetrators of violent crimes.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14232,Unbelievable,1,"It's an uncommon treat to see such a strong, multi-generational cast of women holding together a work that illuminates a vitally important issue.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14233,Unbelievable,1,"'Unbelievable' is a gripping and harrowing story that demands your attention throughout without ever sensationalising its subject matter, but rather handles it with the sensitivity and respect it deserves.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14234,Unbelievable,1,"This is a startlingly faithful adaptation and as such, it checks the boxes a piece of investigative journalism might check: It shows what happened, yes, but also why.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14235,Unbelievable,1,"It's a tough watch, but it's a rewarding one, not just because it has one of the best ensembles of the year but because of what it says about hope and empathy.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14236,Unbelievable,1,"Even as Unbelievable hits familiar beats, it never loses its resonance.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14237,Unbelievable,1,This occasionally emotionally manipulative but consistently engaging drama stays true to the sensitivity of the case at its core whilst maintaining its entertainment value.,Netflix,98%,89%,84

14240,Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable isn't just a gripping story, it's an incredibly compelling argument for why we need to take a frank look at the way victims of sexual assault are treated and how seriously we take them.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14241,Unbelievable,1,"Dever play[s] her heartbreak in quiet and deepening shadings, never pandering for outrage.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14242,Unbelievable,1,Unbelievable is a superb example of what show-don't-tell storytelling looks like.,Netflix,98%,89%,84
14243,Unbelievable,1,Kaitlyn Dever's heartbreaking performance as the vilified Marie will make you desperate for vindication.,Netflix,98%,89%,84
14244,Unbelievable,1,"Created by Erin Brockovich screenwriter Susannah Grant and directed by Olive Kitteridge's Lisa Cholodenko, Unbelievable's eight-part, True Detective-style investigation is gripping, emotion-inducing viewing.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14245,Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable depicts the heartbreaking, yet gratifying, moment these parallel stories finally intersected.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14246,Unbelievable,1,"Measured in many aspects and mercurial in other ways, Unbelievable is unmissable.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14247,Unbelievable,0,The series feels like a vehicle built merely to convey the information dug up by its progenitors.,Netflix,98%,89%,84
14248,Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable is an extremely satisfying experience - not just for its storytelling, but for its depiction of women who confront their reality rather than succumbing to it.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14249,Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable, at its best, is focused less on the system at large than on one individual ground up by it.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14250,Unbelievable,1,Unbelievable is a knockout crime drama that pushes the genre ahead with tenderness.,Netflix,98%,89%,84
14251,Unbelievable,1,"""Unbelievable"" is an extremely compelling suspenseful drama based on a true story.",Netflix,98%,89%,84
14252,The Crown,0,"Duty may be life and pain for the royal family. But in The Crown, it's also ultimately spiritless.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14253,The Crown,1,"You've got to hand it to screenwriter Peter Morgan, he does know how to wring out every last drop of psychological drama from stories with which we might otherwise feel overfamiliar.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14254,The Crown,0,"The Crown has firmly placed itself as yet another vehicle of Britain's colonial amnesia, blissfully neglectful of the collective traumas of postcolonial nations.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14255,The Crown,1,"Eminently watchable, eternally classy, and enormously well performed, S4 sparkles and other points exasperates, but in that sense reflects the tenor of the era it covers.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14256,The Crown,1,"""White rich people dealing with white rich problems"" remains one of TV's most satisfying genres. In a year without Succession, no series could dethrone Peter Morgan's royal drama. The fourth season was the jewel in its crown.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14257,The Crown,1,"The Crown creators have outdone themselves this season, and as they prepare for a time jump and a cast change, it's sad to see such a strong cast go - but we can't wait to see what they have in store next.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14258,The Crown,1,"From the shy smile, to the cocked head and whispered voice, [Corrin] has perfectly captured the mouse that eventually roared.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14259,The Crown,1,"The Crown's fourth outing is the show back at its best. You may well come to it for the visual feast of Diana and Thatcher, but you'll leave with lots of food for thought - the mark of great telly.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14260,The Crown,1,"It is never gripping but it is always entertaining: a much-needed dollop of well-made, well-written, slowly-paced telly.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14261,The Crown,1,"It's telling that the most sympathetic newcomer this season is Michael Fagan, the Brit who sneaked into the palace in 1982 and confronted the queen in her bedroom.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14262,The Crown,1,"It is, without a doubt, the season many Crown viewers have been waiting for.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14263,The Crown,1,"The real star of this fourth season is, inevitably, Diana.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14264,The Crown,1,"The dissonance between spoiled Royals and the modern world has turned darker, and the nobility seems a lot less noble. But it's still a fascinating mess for us mere mortals to watch.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14265,The Crown,1,"Corrin beautifully brings to life the shy magnetism coupled with the fragile naivety of the iconic Princess, as well as the rumored affairs and eating disorder resulting from the pain and isolation of life inside a loveless marriage on the world stage.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14266,The Crown,1,It's the kind of run that would have kept the Queen Mum glued to the telly.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14267,The Crown,1,"Colman remains a delight, and I could watch her read a phone book.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14268,The Crown,1,"[It] does not suddenly find a low-key groove - it deploys a hunting metaphor with which it repeatedly slaps the viewer around the face in these first episodes - but because the subject matter is so big and bombastic, it does fit together with more ease.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14269,The Crown,1,"Decades of perspective and mythmaking make it impossible to turn away. This season, The Crown takes a step forward and lives up to the historical moments it brings to life.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14270,The Crown,1,"With Netflix finally delivering the long awaited arrival of Princess Diana and Margaret Thatcher, the pricey royal drama is back in gear with high drama and political intrigue, anchored by two era-defining women.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14271,The Crown,1,Sheesh. It's still a great watch.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14272,The Crown,1,"Just like the real royals, The Crown benefits from the arrival of Diana Spencer.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14273,The Crown,1,The Crown is deeper than just a sumptuous soap opera. It pictorially assesses the social consequences of a once great power in decline.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14274,The Crown,1,"The saga continues with outstanding performances by the entire cast but especially Emma Corrin, Josh O'Connor and Gillian Anderson.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14275,The Crown,1,This high-level soap so smoothly builds each climactic moment that even a less emotionally attached viewer will find that this season is one success after another.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14276,The Crown,1,There was an egregious lack of Porchey this season. Truly unforgivable.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14277,The Crown,1,"It's better than the last, which got bogged down a little in dead times. But there is, with modern times, the temptation to take sides; and there's little doubt where creator Peter Morgan has nailed his colours.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14278,The Crown,1,"Emma Corrin, as the princess, perfectly captured Diana's youthful spirit and slowly crumbling optimism. Gillian Anderson made a not terribly convincing Mrs Thatcher, far too mannered, even for made-over Maggie, but otherwise everyone was on their game.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14279,The Crown,1,"It's a triumph, this season, mostly because the Diana we've all been waiting for is a triumph. She is played by Emma Corrin, who is sensational.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14280,The Crown,1,It more than delivers on its consistency but my one major bug bear this time around is the humanisation of a woman who could have given Saddam Hussein a run for his money.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14281,The Crown,1,"Honest and unhampered by affectation, Colman, the most humble of stars, shows us how little Elizabeth knows and how much she needs to know in her changing world.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14282,The Crown,1,"Once more, the second episode of the fourth season returns The Crown to what makes this soap opera so delectable: It's a royal family trapped in archaic rituals cowering in palaces in the hopes of continued survival.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14283,The Crown,1,The real-life melodrama about Great Britain's royal family was already the most addictive show on TV... but now it's way better.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14284,The Crown,1,"The Crown is shrewd enough to start the new series with Charles and Di, but the Prince of Wales needs a crash course in pomposity.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14285,The Crown,1,Diana's arrival gives The Crown a chance to recapture the magic of spectacle. Few series evoke a sense of awe and wonder quite like Morgan's Royal Family fantasies.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14286,The Crown,1,"Emma Corrin is superb as Diana, always believable in her journey from naive teenager thrown in at the deep end to driven yet lonely powerhouse. (Though I'm now over allegorical stags being stalked at Balmoral.)",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14287,The Crown,1,"Emma Corrin captures the shyness of Diana's public face, and it is hard not to empathise as she is left to wallow alone for weeks on end.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14288,The Crown,1,"The Crown takes addictive soap opera drama and elevates it to grand, cinematic heights with picturesque locations, opulent sets, well-researched costumes, and a moving score.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14289,The Crown,1,"The more Gillian Anderson pops into the narrative, the more obvious she's crafted this role into the finest of an already lauded career.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14290,The Crown,1,Series four of The Crown ranks as the most entertaining yet because of the depth of its engagement with the times in which it's set.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14291,The Crown,0,You know there are problems with Gillian Anderson's performance from the moment the camera settles on her ashen Back to the Future hair.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14292,The Crown,1,"I don't know how much literal truth there is in the story The Crown is telling about the royals... But the season's insights into our emotions and familial volatility, and its ways of articulating it in such reflective ways, need no added research.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14293,The Crown,1,"These Charles/Di go-rounds may indeed butter ""The Crown's"" bread, but the real news this time is Gillian Anderson's devastatingly precise portrayal of Margaret Thatcher.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14294,The Crown,1,"While I have no doubt Imelda Staunton will be terrific in the final seasons, The Crown has a way of making you regret the inevitable march of time.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14295,The Crown,1,"It's a credit to newcomer Corrin and partner-in-despair Josh O'Connor - a needy, narcissistic and thoroughly unsympathetic Charles - that their relationship does more than simply rake over old ground.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14296,The Crown,1,"Give Gillian Anderson an Emmy. That's it, that's the sentence.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14297,The Crown,1,"With Season 4, the stakes are higher across the board and the bingeworthiness returns. Spectacular performances go down. Corrin is heartbreaking during many moments, and Gillian Anderson is reaching out for an Emmy.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14298,The Crown,1,"No longer is The Crown merely showing us history, it's making us feel it as if we were living (or reliving) it.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14299,The Crown,1,"Diana's entry into The Crown has been anticipated since the series was first announced, and Corrin's portrayal of the Princess of Wales is delicate and assured enough to live up to the high expectations first-time viewers of the series may have.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14300,The Crown,1,Perhaps the best and most riveting season of the series yet.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14301,The Crown,1,"This season has finally added the last, previously missing piece: a universally gripping narrative.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14302,The Crown,1,Gillian Anderson might be the best Thatcher ever seen on screen. Hers is not so much an impersonation as an inhabitation.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14303,The Crown,1,"There is a welcome, absorbing quality to jumping back into ""The Crown.""",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14304,The Crown,1,"The entrances of Emma Corrin as Princess Diana and Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher steal the show with tour-de-force performances, but the whole cast elevates their game in The Crown's most powerful season yet.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14305,The Crown,1,The characters are excellently utilized by the acting quality. [Full review in Spanish],Netflix,90%,91%,110
14306,The Crown,1,The emotionally charged fourth season of The Crown is a staggering achievement.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14307,The Crown,1,"The Crown is also at its best when it explores the economic and political crises throughout our country's history, which it does a lot in this series.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14308,The Crown,1,This is the season of The Crown you've been waiting for.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14309,The Crown,1,"The Crown continues being one of the best original series on Netflix, giving us excellent scripts, direction, performances, production values, and the ability to transport us to moments on screen. [Full review in Spanish]",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14310,The Crown,1,"Gillian Anderson is a revelation in the role of Thatcher, giving one of the finest performances of her career.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14311,The Crown,1,"The fourth season of The Crown is nothing short of spectacular. Bringing to life Britain under Thatcherism, and weaving in the story of the young Princess Diana and her dysfunctional marriage with Prince Charles is prodigiously delivered.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14312,The Crown,1,Anderson's brilliant portrayal shows the prime minister at her most human and her most inhumane.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14313,The Crown,1,"For three seasons, as it dutifully focused on Elizabeth and her immediate family, The Crown sometimes seemed to give itself nothing to push back against...this season, it belongs to the victims as well.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14314,The Crown,1,Diana's much-awaited appearance suggests The Crown's appeal does not necessarily lie in the trappings of monarchy so much as in the possibility of its destruction.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14315,The Crown,1,Season 4 manages to perfectly capture everything we love to hate about this fictitious version of the royal family and is only elevated by Anderson and Corrin's introductions of Thatcher and Diana.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14316,The Crown,1,Helena Bonham Carter's Princess Margaret is beautifully nuanced and Olivia Coleman as Queen Elizabeth continues her stellar work.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14317,The Crown,1,No longer are we gazing at expensively made period drama about barely knowable people. We are looking in the rearview mirror at people and events that galvanized the world not long ago.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14318,The Crown,1,"10 episodes of television that may not be uniformly among the show's finest, but which are somehow its most authentic.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14319,The Crown,1,"The new season of the series is delicious, and I ate it up rather quickly, and now I'm hungry for more. It's as beautifully shot as ever, every visual is breathtaking.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14320,The Crown,1,"The best and most addictive season yet. All 10 episodes are a binge-watcher's dream. Olivia Colman is the shining jewel in 'The Crown,"" but Emmy love, please, for Emma Corrin as Lady Di and a knockout Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14321,The Crown,1,"In season four, the show's resemblance to The Godfather is more pronounced than ever. The royals have more in common with a crime family than they'd perhaps like to believe, but at least the Corleones cared for each other.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14322,The Crown,0,"Sadly, what we get here from the Peter Morgan-created series is substantially tweaked timelines and substandard soap that is far less ""character"" and more live-action spitting image caricature.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14323,The Crown,1,"If anything, Season 4 of ""The Crown"" suffers from an overabundance of plotlines that beg for more attention, whether it's Princess Margaret coping with her diminished status, or the bracingly snide depiction of Prince Andrew.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14324,The Crown,1,"This new set of episodes continues to give us both the long run and the short, the epic and the specific, as it goes from strength to strength.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14325,The Crown,1,"The season that finally introduces Diana, Princess of Wales, is one of the series' strongest.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14326,The Crown,1,"Season four of The Crown leans heavily on the Charles/Diana drama, but is still a great watch.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14327,The Crown,1,Best season yet.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14328,The Crown,1,"The Crown observes that the royals' failures can more often than not be self-inflicted -- and in doing so, the show produces its most thrilling and biting season yet.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14329,The Crown,1,"Anderson's transformation is mesmerizing, not least the feeble, raspy voice that belies the strength and ruthlessness with which Thatcher sets about her business.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14330,The Crown,1,"The dramatic pacing of this season is very intelligent, as is its decision to leap beyond the palace walls from time to time to illustrate the straitened circumstances of those at the wrong end of Mrs Thatcher's laissez-faire capitalist experiments.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14331,The Crown,1,"The show remains an utterly enjoyable binge, even if the latest season doesn't quite measure up to the previous ones -- a byproduct of the years and conflicts encompassed.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14332,The Crown,1,"Corrin is startlingly good at capturing the princess' charismatic shimmer. Her Diana is silly and eager for attention... Yet this winsome young woman also exudes warmth, decency and fun.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14333,The Crown,1,"Ultimately, though, what Thatcher and especially Diana do is land maternal doubts at Elizabeth's feet. It's a facet of the queen we've seldom seen even on The Crown.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14334,The Crown,1,"The sheer audaciousness of the script continues to thrill: how could anyone know what the Queen and Princess Anne talked about, seated on a picnic blanket in the middle of nowhere?",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14335,The Crown,1,"Together, Thatcher and Diana give The Crown an energy and a sense of direction it lacked in the third season, and a feeling of verve the show has arguably never approached before.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14336,The Crown,1,"The result is an absorbing season, both incredibly satisfying and, often, painful to watch unfold.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14337,The Crown,1,There's no fairy tale here; only a real-life soap opera plotline that played out in front of billions. That's part of the reason why this season works so well.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14338,The Crown,1,"'The Crown' Season 4 finds itself caught between trying to maintain its gilded scenery and elegant trappings, and the lurid tabloid appeal of indiscretions, martial chaos, and familial infighting. The results make for some sharply-realised drama.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14339,The Crown,1,"THE CROWN is an impeccably crafted, gorgeously shot, and fantastically performed saga. It loves its royals, yet also pities them, and maybe even reviles such scoundrels. You will too.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14340,The Crown,1,"If you think the Roys play a mean game of Boar on the Floor, wait until you see the Royals!",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14341,The Crown,1,"Much of series three felt like a warm up act, a prelude to bigger, better drama. With the arrival of some new blood in the form of Gillian Anderson's Thatcher and Emma Corrin's Princess Diana, round four provides just that.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14342,The Crown,1,"I remember in detail almost every event here that I found it so entertaining. Yes, there is a shaky start and the odd historical inaccuracy, but it is in my view Morgan's best series yet and, overall, five-star television.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14343,The Crown,1,"Many actresses have essayed Mrs Thatcher, but her biographer Charles Moore is surely correct in his assertion that Gillian Anderson's performance here is the most convincing yet.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14344,The Crown,1,"Playing Lady Diana from a waifish teen to a young wife to a miserable princess, Emma Corrin nails the head tilts and shy smiles, effortless glamour, and inner turmoil.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14345,The Crown,1,"Smooth, perhaps not. But it's definitely soapy. For all its flaws, The Crown gives us what we demand from the royal cavalcade - nonstop high drama and emotion, wrapped in a fairytale.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14346,The Crown,1,The stillness at the centre of this storm is Colman. She is quietly riveting as the plot wends its way to a predictable conclusion.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14347,The Crown,1,"The show wouldn't work nearly as well as it does, however, without its uniformly excellent performances",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14348,The Crown,1,"The main takeaway in Season 4, though, will be Morgan's interpretation of the story of Charles and Diana and the performances of Josh O'Connor and Corrin in those roles.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14349,The Crown,1,"Anderson embodies the PM's physicality precisely. Aided by the words of writer, creator and executive producer Peter Morgan, Anderson gifts Thatcher with a rare nuance and flinty emotion that reads as entirely authentic.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14350,The Crown,1,"The Crown has successfully sold itself as one of TV's most serious dramas. The fourth season, in all its shameless glory, may be its most successful yet even as it puts that prestigious perception to bed.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14351,The Crown,1,"The Crown season four is a success, by and large - especially when it comes to Charles and Diana - but at times I did feel it was uneven and imperfect.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14352,The Crown,1,"Even when The Crown isn't at its best from a story perspective, the series remains one of the best looking shows out there, from a technical standpoint.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14353,The Crown,0,The show seriously falters with Diana... The Crown prides itself on verisimilitude and that starts to fall away in Season 4.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14354,The Crown,1,"What makes Corrin a good Diana is that she too possesses an inherent charm and appeal. She remains sympathetic throughout, even in scenes with O'Connor when the two are shouting at one another as their marriage collapses.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14355,The Crown,1,"All of this is familiar. Very painfully, infuriatingly familiar. But as ""The Crown"" in this season shows, with a steel spine and ice in its veins, the Monarchy was built to withstand whatever onslaught comes its way.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14356,The Crown,1,"O'Connor is uncannily skilled at portraying the prince's chimeric moods - the arrogance and entitlement, the hangdog malaise, the insecurity and yearning.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14357,The Crown,1,"Brilliantly compelling television that you will absolutely rattle through. A huge turnaround from the previous season, with much more excitement provided by newcomers Thatcher and Diana. A triumph.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14358,The Crown,1,"A stunning fourth season finds Queen Elizabeth, Margaret Thatcher & Diana Spencer in royal, political and marital turmoil. A masterpiece in storytelling & cinematic artistry.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14359,The Crown,1,"The Crown season 4 might be the most interesting season of the Netflix show yet, for one key reason: it seems determined to make us dislike, even downright loathe, every member of the House of Windsor, from Queen Elizabeth on down.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14360,The Crown,1,"The fourth season of The Crown isn't fully a triumph, but the episodes where it focuses more on the societal changes rocking the country during Thatcher's rule and less on the domestic squabbles are some of the strongest in its entire run.",Netflix,90%,91%,110
14361,The Crown,1,The Crown season 4 is the best season yet of the Netflix royal drama and boasts added momentum and marvellous performances with the additions of Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher and newcomer Emma Corrin as Princess Diana.,Netflix,90%,91%,110
14362,BoJack Horseman,1,"Once again, Bojack is asking the societal questions that few TV shows are.",Netflix,93%,95%,54
14363,BoJack Horseman,1,"I'm hopeful that the second part of the show's final season will... further shift from BoJack's limited lens and, instead, give these women the space, time, and justice they need to heal - on their terms.",Netflix,93%,95%,54
14364,BoJack Horseman,1,"I binged BoJack during a lossy time in my life. I watched to absorb a truism in digestible cartoon form: the more we flail around trying to avoid the pain of loss, the more we lose.",Netflix,93%,95%,54
14365,BoJack Horseman,1,"This 2014-2020 anamorphic animated comedy/drama manages to touch on so many real-life examples of social, cultural, political, and philosophical events that infuse the human condition.",Netflix,93%,95%,54
14366,BoJack Horseman,1,"If it disappoints, well, that is ""classic BoJack"": the show, like its antihero, will make you love it even as it lets you down.",Netflix,93%,95%,54
14367,BoJack Horseman,1,"Like all every topic the show has courageously covered in its six seasons, Bojack's ending drives the point home that there are no neatly wrapped conclusions. In fact, it's almost boring-life's a bitch, but it goes on.",Netflix,93%,95%,54
14368,BoJack Horseman,1,"The humour almost always lands, and while it rarely goes for belly laughs, it is more about light moments of relief as BoJack's world comes crashing down.",Netflix,93%,95%,54
14369,BoJack Horseman,1,"This result - a finale that asks ""How does BoJack go on with his life now?"" without really giving a solid answer - is a fitting one for a show that wanted to explore the life of an awful person with unexamined mental health issues and addiction.",Netflix,93%,95%,54

14412,BoJack Horseman,1,"On a technical level, the first half of BoJack Horseman season 6 is another masterstroke of adult animation, stuffed with whiplash-inducing sight gags and zingers. Emotionally, it leaves me wanting more-which, in all fairness, is the point.",Netflix,93%,95%,54

14486,The OA,1,"The second season continues to blur genres, jump into surprise directions, and thrill in its visual palette, but an air of pretension, and the occasional baffling moment, holds the show back from entirely resonating on an emotional level.",Netflix,84%,84%,37
14487,The OA,1,"I loved it. I did not expect 2019 to be the year The OA went from a show I ironically tell people to watch if they plan on doing mescaline to a genuinely joyful, wildly worth-it ride through what-the-hecksville.",Netflix,84%,84%,37

14489,The OA,1,"The OA: Part II packs each frame so dense with detail, that not one second of the new season's more-than-eight-hour runtime seems wasted, expositional, cheap, or unearned.",Netflix,84%,84%,37
14490,The OA,1,"The OA reminds us it's natural to feel out of place, and tries to instill a little faith in what's to come. More, it wants us to really feel our feelings about it without the cover of jokes or irony.",Netflix,84%,84%,37

14507,The Order,1,"What makes The Order season 2 a superior follow-up is how obviously it recognizes which aspects of the show work best; it's rife with knowing humor, fun character pairings, and imaginative twists on its established mythology.",Netflix,100%,73%,5
14508,The Order,1,"The struggle between Midnight and Silverback was as compelling as always, however, and credit must be given for The OrderÂ's continuing ability to make MidnightÂ's new champion, Gabrielle, simultaneously obnoxious and sympathetic at the same time.",Netflix,100%,73%,5

14522,Godless,0,"There are interesting ideas and some refreshing roles here, languorously trailed among the endless vistas. But these ideas flare and subside in the slow sprawl of the show, without the assurance of a guiding hand.",Netflix,83%,85%,80

14538,Godless,1,The landscapes are bleakly arresting and the violence when it comes is suitably chilling.,Netflix,83%,85%,80
14539,Godless,1,For all the shock that Godless squeezes out of just how far Frank is willing to go-and how far the amiable star playing him is willing to push himself-the show uses its seven often hour-long-plus episodes carefully.,Netflix,83%,85%,80
14540,Godless,1,"Godless left me empty, despite its abundance of great talent...The most compelling thing about Godless may be the gender dynamics simmering in the background.",Netflix,83%,85%,80

14543,Godless,1,The baby steps Godless takes in unpacking its maleness from a premise of matriarchy makes it obvious just how far the genre has to go.,Netflix,83%,85%,80
14544,Godless,1,"This is a show that really loves the earth, even if it doesn't embrace the country - it knows what American can be at its best and what it is at its worst.",Netflix,83%,85%,80
14545,Godless,1,"True to form, Godless gives us a sex worker, but she's not an accessory. She's retired, and, financially speaking, she's the most powerful woman in the narrative, which makes sense.",Netflix,83%,85%,80

14549,Godless,1,"The result is a series that feels both traditional and new, with the big-screen qualities of a film and the story and character nuance of the best serialized television. This last is exploited to best advantage by Frank's cast.",Netflix,83%,85%,80

14558,Godless,1,"A seven-hours-plus honest-to-gosh western created by writer-director Scott Frank, Godless features cowboys on horses, lots of shootin' and ropin', and a feminist twist so thoroughly integrated into the premise, no ornery dude can possibly complain.",Netflix,83%,85%,80

14560,Godless,1,The result is an endlessly watchable limited series that is a magnificent addition to the Western genre and one of the best and most surprising offerings from Netflix in recent memory.,Netflix,83%,85%,80
14561,Godless,1,Godless delivers. And it's both smart and entertaining in the process.,Netflix,83%,85%,80
14562,Godless,1,Not since Lonesome Dove have I had such a good time cheering on -- and worrying over -- such an engaging gallery of heroes.,Netflix,83%,85%,80
14563,Godless,1,"Don't get me wrong--Godless is a spectacular show, and well worth watching...But still, it feels like a missed opportunity to have built up the conceit of a ""no man's land"" ruled by women, and fail to deliver on the feminism.",Netflix,83%,85%,80
14564,Godless,1,... odless is clever in both its approach and its focus...,Netflix,83%,85%,80
14565,Godless,1,"It feels nearly impossible to shake-up the genre, which I grew up watching thanks to my father, who is absolutely obsessed with throwback-ish style. And, yet, Netflix's new series Godless manages to do just that.",Netflix,83%,85%,80

14567,Godless,1,"Godless is grim, exciting and visually arresting. It's slow, but necessarily so, patiently offering vital exposition while its classic, western plot unfurls itself violently.",Netflix,83%,85%,80
14568,Godless,1,"I can tell you that I did not want to curse my television, and that ""Godless,"" the grimness of its title notwithstanding, goes somewhere almost corny, but kind of beautiful.",Netflix,83%,85%,80
14569,Godless,1,"Brutal, unforgiving, and warmly nostalgic; Netflix's grand Western is one of 2017's most satisfying shows.",Netflix,83%,85%,80
14570,Godless,1,"It gets way more right than wrong as an outstanding cast, memorable characters, engaging arcs, beautiful shots of the majestic frontier, and one hell of a finale (oh yes, it's pretty savage) bring us a uniquely bewitching and exciting story.",Netflix,83%,85%,80
14571,Godless,1,"It's an operatic, juicy drama that thrives by earnestly embracing the best -and side-stepping the worst - Western tropes.",Netflix,83%,85%,80

14573,Godless,1,"Buoyed by strong performances and its knowing embrace of an under-utilized genre, this seven-part event slows in the middle but yields the kind of home stretch for which it's worth giving thanks.",Netflix,83%,85%,80
14574,Godless,1,"If he (Scott Frank) doesn't achieve the visual or narrative poetry of the filmmakers he's riffing on -- the John Fords, Howard Hawkses and Robert Altmans -- he still gives you plenty to look at, and it's never boring.",Netflix,83%,85%,80
14575,Godless,1,"There's great acting to be found, and some thoughtful writing-and if you like sweeping panoramas of the sun setting across an untamed wild, then you're in excellent, if heavy, hands.",Netflix,83%,85%,80
14576,Godless,1,"Every frame is breathtaking in its own way, whether it's of dust carried on the wind (a classic, tumbleweed-style indication that the characters are remote and exposed) or sun pouring through the slats of an old, dilapidated barn.",Netflix,83%,85%,80
14577,Godless,1,"Indeed, the only major issue with Godless as a thoughtful and engaging entertainment is that you're constantly aware that it could have been so much more than that.",Netflix,83%,85%,80
14578,Godless,1,"Every moment counts, making for an overall experience as to-the-point as Mary Agnes herself. Even when it appears to be taking some extra time for itself, ""Godless"" isn't wasting a second.",Netflix,83%,85%,80
14579,Godless,1,"If you're a sucker for Westerns, boy, are you going to love Godless. If you're not a sucker for Westerns, boy, are you going to love Godless anyway.",Netflix,83%,85%,80
14580,Godless,1,"The sun will never fully set on the Western, because it is the story of us, and, as great Westerns like Godless prove, a story that is far more complicated -- and far more relevant to our own time -- than white hats versus black hats.",Netflix,83%,85%,80
14581,Godless,1,"If you love Westerns, this is definitely one to try. If you don't, check it out anyway; it's very likely to seduce you.",Netflix,83%,85%,80

14583,Godless,1,"Godless is beautiful. Whether you have a love of westerns or not, the blue skies of New Mexico are fully utilized with the dusty, sprawling landscapes that were once the cornerstone of the American West.",Netflix,83%,85%,80
14584,Godless,1,"Godless keeps its world as expansive as the vast plains, so beautifully shot on location in Santa Fe. The supporting cast s strong, but no one is more electric than the always extraordinary Merritt Wever.",Netflix,83%,85%,80
14585,Godless,1,Godless is the Western you've been waiting for.,Netflix,83%,85%,80
14586,Godless,1,"It's a big, brave western, culturally penetrating and entertaining in way that makes you savour scenes and dialogue, rather than anticipating the next jolt.",Netflix,83%,85%,80
14587,Godless,0,"In Godless, female empowerment resembles the adoption of a rigid construction of masculinity.",Netflix,83%,85%,80
14588,Godless,0,Godless has a great throwback Western movie buried somewhere under all the excess flab.,Netflix,83%,85%,80

14592,Love,1,"Even when Netlifx evolves into a tiny chip, planted into the brains of our descendants on a space colony somewhere, the story captured in the three seasons of Love will still resonate. These are truths that will never disappear.",Netflix,94%,87%,11
14593,Love,1,"Even though it goes a little overboard at times in terms of pleasing the audience with a litany of happy endings for its talented ensemble, it's overall an entertaining and relatively speedy binge-watch that bids farewell to a charming and unlikely tale.",Netflix,94%,87%,11

14599,Love,1,"Love manages to close on its own terms, on an unconventionally hopeful note. But it also provides something that most of us seek but don't often find from our television shows: a couple of genuine surprises we didn't see coming.",Netflix,94%,87%,11
14600,Love,1,"Love's swan song amounts to a leisurely final lap that may not be as powerful and eye-opening as its first two seasons, but it's a season that feels like the natural progression of everything that's come before.",Netflix,94%,87%,11

14609,Dead End: Paranormal Park,1,Dead End: Paranormal Park is easily one of the best animated shows of the year so far. It is a fun supernatural adventure with a huge heart.,Netflix,100%,76%,6

14611,The End of the F...ing World,1,"The End of the ****ing World season 2 predictably doesn't have the same manic energy or sense of revelation as the first go-around, but it retains the pitch-black nihilism and expert situational humor - it might even be funnier",Netflix,94%,92%,36
14612,The End of the F...ing World,1,"The second season... is a bummer because it's not as good as the first season, but more detrimentally, it undoes the perfection that is the first season. Other than that, though, it's a moderately entertaining three hours.",Netflix,94%,92%,36

14614,The End of the F...ing World,1,"Albeit the second (and most likely final) season of The End of the F***ing World isn't as impactful or satisfying as its daring predecessor, it's a harmless epilogue that sketches a creamy outcome for these perturbed characters.",Netflix,94%,92%,36

14616,The End of the F...ing World,1,"...an epilogue that ends not far from where it began and doesn't connect as well as the original story.

14617,The End of the F...ing World,1,"These kids win my heart and make me guffaw. Please, BBC/Netflix, don't make a third season. I want to walk away and always remember Alyssa and James in their awful, tentative, f***ed-up glory.",Netflix,94%,92%,36
14618,The End of the F...ing World,1,"How do you describe a television show that's unlike any other? To oversimplify it, ""The End of the F***ing World,"" is a pitch-black comedy about a pair of troubled 17-year-olds who meet and fall in love in a very unconventional way.",Netflix,94%,92%,36

14638,The End of the F...ing World,1,"It's all still amusing, and the notes of strangled romanticism and just-perceptible nobility are still in place. But the plot doesn't have the momentum and the crazy energy it did the first time around.",Netflix,94%,92%,36
14639,The End of the F...ing World,0,"If the first season came across as an update on Natural Born Killers, the second begins with a very strong Kill Bill vibe. Unfortunately, it's a vibe the season can't sustain.",Netflix,94%,92%,36
14640,The End of the F...ing World,1,[Jessica] Barden and [Alex] Lawther excel; their characters perfectly toeing the line between being haunted by their pasts - both are subsequently more awkward and angry around one another - and confused teenage chemistry.,Netflix,94%,92%,36
14641,The End of the F...ing World,1,"Shot and styled with flair, it is depraved nihilism made to look cool and it is up to you whether that makes the show objectionable or a dark thrill-ride. Either way, it is exactly why the kids will love it.",Netflix,94%,92%,36
14642,The End of the F...ing World,1,"The result was bleak but dry, wry and hopelessly romantic, like Badlands relocated to Seventies suburbia. The series is stripped across the schedules for four nights, promising to surprise and beguile as much as the first.",Netflix,94%,92%,36
14643,The End of the F...ing World,1,"It's the pace that makes it sing. Of course there were some manoeuvres to pull off, to bring all of the characters back into the fray, but it has been done with as little clumsiness as possible.",Netflix,94%,92%,36
14644,The End of the F...ing World,1,"Lawther also is reliably excellent and conveys grief, confusion and, yes, some joy, in equally revelatory ways. Ackie is equally sure-handed in making Bonnie a compelling compilation of damaged, naive, sad and lethal.",Netflix,94%,92%,36

14652,Narcos,1,"If television could imitate the overwhelmed feeling DEA agents likely felt approaching these cartels, this would be it. This season is intense, fast-paced, and a must watch.",Netflix,89%,95%,32
14653,Narcos,1,"The continuity provided by the theme music aside, Narcos Season 3 essentially functions as the start of a brand new series under the Narcos umbrella -- a backdoor anthology, if you will.",Netflix,89%,95%,32
14654,Narcos,1,"It's ridiculous, barbaric and cruel; it's also great entertainment.",Netflix,89%,95%,32

14663,Narcos,1,"With history on its side, and as its table settling, Narcos somehow found a way to actually become better in its third season, without the crutch of Pablo Escobar in fact, by delivering a killer (real) premise and some augmented thrills.",Netflix,89%,95%,32
14664,Narcos,1,"[Narcos] is essentially a collection of hyperstylized historical reenactments. And yet, it is, right now, the best crime show on television.",Netflix,89%,95%,32

14667,Narcos,1,"Out from under the shadow of Pablo Escobar, Netflix's drug war drama has found an exciting new storyline to follow and it's all headed up by Pascal, who finally gets to play the series' leading man.",Netflix,89%,95%,32
14668,Narcos,1,The new season is still really quite good. I enjoyed it more than either of the first two seasons.,Netflix,89%,95%,32

14671,Narcos,1,"In his plight, Narcos proves a stinging portrait of the war on drugs as akin to stepping in quicksand: Best to avoid it altogether, because once you're in, you're in for good... until you've drowned.",Netflix,89%,95%,32

14673,Narcos,1,"Narcos wrapped up its Pablo Escobar storyline in two terrific seasons, raising the question of what the show could possibly do for an encore without Wagner Moura in that role. The answer, it turns out, was to splendidly hit the reset button.",Netflix,89%,95%,32
14674,Narcos,1,This tactical shift changes the nature of Narcos significantly in season 3 from the hunt of a single terror into the quixotic quest to destroy a violent network that begets other savage networks in other countries.,Netflix,89%,95%,32
14675,Narcos,1,"It is one of the great examples of shows that have improved thanks to the opportunity to grow and evolve, and Season 3 continues that journey with an investment in human storytelling.",Netflix,89%,95%,32
14676,Narcos,1,"If you ever needed proof that television is the new gold standard of storytelling, look no further than Narcos. Season 3 is not only the best installment of the series to date, but it's also a thrilling, white-knuckle ride.",Netflix,89%,95%,32
14677,Narcos,1,"Season three seizes the vacuum left by Escobar as an opportunity to bring an intricate, thrilling and ultimately depressing narrative to the fore. Its craft is reminiscent of The Wire's latter seasons.",Netflix,89%,95%,32
14678,Safe,0,"Safe could have been so good. All the ingredients were there for a prime binge-worthy crime thriller - the writers, the cast, the concept - but it just hasn't been given the time, care and attention it needed.",Netflix,71%,76%,24
14679,Safe,0,There are few series on streaming or anywhere else that will cause as few ripples.,Netflix,71%,76%,24
14680,Safe,1,"The ensemble cast makes it all click. There are plenty of moments in Safe where the story and its twists threaten to derail the tightly wound mayhem, but the cast saves it from ever tipping over.",Netflix,71%,76%,24
14681,Safe,1,"Still, this is a British mystery made for TV, and the form is a winner, despite some overwrought music that supplies more tension than the script calls for.",Netflix,71%,76%,24
14682,Safe,0,Safe isn't without its ticking clock grittiness and compelling riddles but there's also unintended comedy involved with a story where everyone somehow unwittingly contributes to someone's dire demise.,Netflix,71%,76%,24
14683,Safe,1,We have to talk about that accent.,Netflix,71%,76%,24
14684,Safe,1,"All in all, it's good, soapy fun. If you're willing to suspend your disbelief, you're likely to get swept up in its current, and once that happens, I'd wager that all eight episodes will safely disappear in a flash.",Netflix,71%,76%,24
14685,Safe,1,"Safe does promise plenty of twists and turns for loyal mystery lovers, and the supporting cast, including Sherlock's Amanda Abbington, is extremely capable.",Netflix,71%,76%,24

14688,Safe,1,"It's really rather good, and both Hall and Abbington are superb to watch, fine actors adding texture to the wildly twisted plotting and the gusty dialogue that would make many actors knackered.",Netflix,71%,76%,24
14689,Safe,1,"Finding out why they are so guarded, and where all the bodies (figuratively and literally) are buried, is what makes this series a potential binge candidate.",Netflix,71%,76%,24
14690,Safe,0,It's a thriller by numbers that doesn't feel clever enough for its talented cast.,Netflix,71%,76%,24
14691,Safe,1,"Excellent acting all round; twisty plot that holds your attention; even better than ""The Five"" and that means it is superb TV viewing. Worth the bingewatching thrill.",Netflix,71%,76%,24
14692,Safe,0,"Skip it, unless you're a Hall or Coben completist. It just feels like the twists aren't going to be nearly as twisty as Coben thinks they're going to be.",Netflix,71%,76%,24
14693,Safe,1,Safe is... top-quality TV drama.,Netflix,71%,76%,24
14694,Safe,1,"With committed performances (some of which are clearly aware of the ludicrous story they're in) and a brisk pace, Safe earns its status as a soapy pleasure and should entertain Netflix viewers craving engaging distraction.",Netflix,71%,76%,24
14695,Safe,1,"I'm very much enjoying these people, without really caring about them.",Netflix,71%,76%,24
14696,Safe,1,"Almost everything about Safe, from the acting to the dialogue, is pulpy with a vengeance.",Netflix,71%,76%,24

14698,Safe,1,Those who enjoyed Broadchurch and Doctor Foster should definitely check out Netflix's latest British thriller Safe...,Netflix,71%,76%,24
14699,Safe,1,Boasts a quality cast and slick script [and] brings a tone of nightmarish slapstick.,Netflix,71%,76%,24
14700,Safe,0,"[Michael C.] Hall's accent, reasonably consistent and yet rarely believable, is one of many things on Safe that are askew and, the more I think about it, the more I can't tell if it's intentional if not particularly satisfying, or merely bad.",Netflix,71%,76%,24
14701,Safe,1,Generally delivers the kinds of well-paced twists that mystery fans are likely to enjoy.,Netflix,71%,76%,24
14702,Ginny & Georgia,1,"It was fun and quick and interesting and I found myself just as intrigued with the adults' storylines as the teens' storylines, which is a rare find for me. It's imperfect, of course, but it was a fast, fun watch.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14703,Ginny & Georgia,0,"The body of the series is a bantery young-adult soap, the head a woman-on-the-edge thriller, and the tail a race melodrama. The creator, Sarah Lampert, must have looked upon her handiwork with proud amusement.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14704,Ginny & Georgia,1,"This manic, mystery-fueled mother-daughter drama reels in viewers with more sex, drugs, and violence in the first episode than we saw in seven seasons of the Gilmore Girls.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14705,Ginny & Georgia,1,"Ginny and Georgia has its fair share issues, but it handles teen sexuality without preaching or condemning and offers a path where sex doesn't have to mean much at all.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14706,Ginny & Georgia,1,"Whether or not Ginny & Georgia is ""good"" depends heavily on how many edibles you've consumed before watching. Wellsbury is certainly not Stars Hollow.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14707,Ginny & Georgia,0,"The script's plotholes... [starts] so many stories that, in the dent, it doesn't end up providing the screen time that each one deserves. [Full review in Spanish]",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14708,Ginny & Georgia,1,"Howey and Gentry are great both together and separately, the show's twisting plots are addictive and soapy without being too implausible, and there's a thoughtfulness in its approach to issues of race, sexuality and parenting. I kinda loved it.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14709,Ginny & Georgia,0,Ginny & Georgia isn't the new 'Gilmore Girls.' It's a mess...,Netflix,68%,69%,31
14710,Ginny & Georgia,1,"There were some very funny moments, but they mostly involved the supporting characters.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14711,Ginny & Georgia,1,"Gentry's sensitive performance shoulders the weight of Ginny & Georgia, and she wears her character's excitement, hope and pain with a heartbreaking lightness.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14712,Ginny & Georgia,0,"If the writers trimmed away one or two, the mother-daughter tension at its core could shine. But with so much going on, that dynamic gets lost.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14713,Ginny & Georgia,1,"Ginny is living a teen drama, while Georgia has a closet full of skeletons in a thriller mystery. Somehow these two lanes work to tell a compelling story about family, the secrets we keep, and the truth that we may all become our parents eventually.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14714,Ginny & Georgia,1,"Lampert, Fisher, and company are at their best when writing for Ginny, and Gentry doesn't miss a beat.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14715,Ginny & Georgia,1,"Surprisingly, it pretty much all works. The dark secrets (there are many) balance with the apparent fluff, making for an engaging, never-dull series. Maybe the Gilmore Girls should have had guns.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14716,Ginny & Georgia,1,"Ginny & Georgia is perfect background TV: familiar enough to be comforting, but with enough of its own weird energy to let Netflix's autoplay jump into the next episode.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14717,Ginny & Georgia,1,"Plot-wise, G&G delivers. Good trash-plotting is like a river in full spate. A lot rushes past you, it all feels Very Dramatic (although, unlike a river, mostly because of the way it is scored) and you feel like the source will never run dry.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14718,Ginny & Georgia,1,"The whole package may be dubiously conceived and overstuffed, but there's enough going on that some of it can't help but work.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14719,Ginny & Georgia,0,"Unfortunately, the show's ambitions for bigger stakes mean trading in some of the character-based intimacy that is the series' calling card. Go big or go home, they say - but Ginny & Georgia makes a strong case for staying cozy.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14720,Ginny & Georgia,1,"It won't all make sense in the moment, but it settles well enough after 10 episodes. Even the predictability nets out to an enjoyable binge, and the finale has potential to actual surprise us in the future.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14721,Ginny & Georgia,0,"Ginny & Georgia wants us to love the way that Georgia always manages to stay one step ahead... Instead, I kept hoping that Child Protective Services would finally catch up.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14722,Ginny & Georgia,1,"Ginny's very real world and Georgia's very heightened one might both be fun, but because the former is much more successful and better executed, the latter starts to feel like marking time.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14723,Ginny & Georgia,1,"Ginny & Georgia is a step beyond Gilmore Girls; it is a better reflection of the world today. Ginny & Georgia is bolder and filled with more diverse, authentic characters that will capture your heart.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14724,Ginny & Georgia,1,"It's loads of fun watching Georgia the scammer in action, and there's always more room for diverse teen stories that aren't weird about things like sexuality and mental illness.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14725,Ginny & Georgia,0,"Ginny & Georgia has its moments, but I'm not sure when dark became today's 'fresh and modern.' A little too dark for teens.",Netflix,68%,69%,31

14727,Ginny & Georgia,0,"Ginny & Georgia winds down its punishingly long first season having shouted a great deal, but said almost nothing at all.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14728,Ginny & Georgia,1,"Ginny & Georgia is still a fun watch, but if you temper your expectations before watching, then you'll probably be able to enjoy it more.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14729,Ginny & Georgia,1,"The result is a show that is so overstuffed it cannot successfully service each of its storylines in a satisfying way. Fortunately, the show remains immensely watchable regardless",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14730,Ginny & Georgia,1,There's also one area where Ginny & Georgia has a clear leg up on its predecessor: It understands from the jump that it's not especially healthy to have a mom who wants to be your best friend and is reluctant to fully grow up herself.,Netflix,68%,69%,31
14731,Ginny & Georgia,0,"Ginny & Georgia seems to have something interesting to say about female beauty standards and the suffocating constrictions of the patriarchy, but it gets jumbled among all the other things the show is trying to be.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14732,Ginny & Georgia,0,"There's a decent YA show in here somewhere, but along with its abundance of plot, Ginny & Georgia needs to step away from the plethora of Gilmore Girls references to get there.",Netflix,68%,69%,31
14733,Feel Good,1,"I felt about this season very similarly to the way I felt about the first: extremely uncomfortable. Martin is a charming performer, but it’s hard to watch someone continually refuse to get the help they need...",Netflix,100%,90%,21
14734,Feel Good,1,"It’s both subtle and not, never shying away from depictions of queer sex or the long-lasting effects of trauma. The result is a show so good you almost can’t believe it exists, let alone that we were blessed with two seasons of it.",Netflix,100%,90%,21
14735,Feel Good,1,"Feel Good may not be everyone's piping-hot mug of kombucha, but there's grit, honesty and a daring kind of silliness here.",Netflix,100%,90%,21
14736,Feel Good,1,"Things get real tough but never too bleak. Devoted girlfriend George (Charlotte Ritchie) and goofy housemate Phil (Phil Burgers) provide loads of laughs and love, and mum Linda (Lisa Kudrow) a darkly surreal tinge. Outstanding television.",Netflix,100%,90%,21
14737,Feel Good,1,"The new episodes of Feel Good are on a par with the old ones -- textured, funny, a bit dramatic, and fitted with a clear theme: trauma and recovery from it.",Netflix,100%,90%,21
14738,Feel Good,1,"""Feel Good"" sends up a familiar brand of generational self-righteousness, but gently, with love.",Netflix,100%,90%,21
14739,Feel Good,1,"Season 2 of Feel Good gets darker and more uncomfortable without abandoning its humorous reprieves, a balance that allows it to cover an astonishing amount without feeling punishing.",Netflix,100%,90%,21
14740,Feel Good,1,"On one level it is one of the best recent LGBTQ dramedies to release anywhere, on another it's a great dramatic conduit for the moods of a generation grappling with mental health and identity.",Netflix,100%,90%,21
14741,Feel Good,1,The second and final season of Mae Martin and Joe Hampson's complicated romantic dramedy gets deeper and rougher - and still earns every laugh.,Netflix,100%,90%,21
14742,Feel Good,1,One of the most audacious things about the series is that it's committed to its love story. The show is romantic. The show is sexy. And that makes us understand Mae and George's hesitancy in taking the risk for something healthier.,Netflix,100%,90%,21
14743,Feel Good,1,The end result is 12 episodes of bittersweet comedic perfection.,Netflix,100%,90%,21
14744,Feel Good,1,Feel Good takes its final bow with a powerful season two of the topsy-turvy love story of George and Mae.,Netflix,100%,90%,21
14745,Feel Good,1,"The second season somehow amplifies the two extremes of the performance perfectly. Also improving on an already terrific turn is Ritchie, who benefits from George's very accurate realization that she needs to figure out a personality.",Netflix,100%,90%,21
14746,Feel Good,1,"Feel Good is at its best when it sets its sights on bigger fish, such as cultural identity and our current obsession with labelling each other.",Netflix,100%,90%,21
14747,Feel Good,1,"Feel Good is a beautiful achievement, kind, human, as clever as it is funny.",Netflix,100%,90%,21
14748,Feel Good,1,"""Feel Good"" accomplishes so much in its tight six episodes that it's both a blessing and curse that it leaves the viewer wanting more.",Netflix,100%,90%,21
14749,Feel Good,1,"Throughout all these messy character and relationship arcs, there's still that goofy and original comedic voice established in the first season that sometimes verges on the absurd. Life is, after all, absurd. And [It] does a brilliant job exploring that.",Netflix,100%,90%,21
14750,Feel Good,1,"In both story and dialogue Martin and Hampson rarely take the easy route or the obvious joke or make sweeping statements. Something that might be easily mocked in a lesser show, is done so here without snark.",Netflix,100%,90%,21
14751,Feel Good,1,Ambitiously navigates modern love and identity with deep empathy and absurd humour.,Netflix,100%,90%,21
14752,Feel Good,1,"Feel Good season 2 is a wonderful 6 chapters, even if we do want more.",Netflix,100%,90%,21
14753,Feel Good,1,"There's a lot more going on, yet most of it works because the core characters were so well established in Season One. The George material in particular is a significant improvement.",Netflix,100%,90%,21
14754,House of Cards,0,"Robin Wright was one of the best things from the previous seasons of House of Cards, but season 6 simple should've never existed. The ghost of Frank Underwood became its doom. Full review in Spanish",Netflix,77%,76%,68

14756,House of Cards,0,"It isn't easy to replace Frank Underwood, who... has become one of the most legendary characters ever portrayed on a TV show. However, it is obvious that this season not only lacked inspiration - it was lacking, in general.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14757,House of Cards,0,"The final season is not the glorious goodbye it should have been, or the one the show's best character and best actor deserved, but there's still enough of that early elegant cruelty to see it across the line.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14758,House of Cards,0,I doubt that I was the only one whose own lethargy gave her cause for revulsion.,Netflix,77%,76%,68

14761,House of Cards,1,"The sixth and last season of House of Cards is worth taking a peek at because, well, it's House of Cards and it put in the work to get where it is.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14762,House of Cards,0,It's eight-hours of filler to set up an immensely unsatisfying conclusion.,Netflix,77%,76%,68

14765,House of Cards,1,The new season of House of Cards doesn't feel like an arbitrary story overhaul in response to the #MeToo crisis. It feels right.,Netflix,77%,76%,68
14766,House of Cards,0,"The final season of House of Cards is too weird and atonal to ignore completely, but it's not good enough to recommend.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14767,House of Cards,1,"Wright is truly stunning on the final season, and gives every second on screen her all in a way that suggests she's always known this should've been her show.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14768,House of Cards,1,"House of Cards's sixth and final season really shines in the middle, when Claire is forced to defend every square inch of her presidency against the Shepherd family's abominable ambushes.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14769,House of Cards,1,"Robin Wright has stepped sublimely up. She dominates by simply inhabiting, as did Francis, every scene in which she appears, and one sees the skull beneath the skin throughout, rather than in snatches.",Netflix,77%,76%,68

14772,House of Cards,1,"The story of Season 6 just doesn't cohere; it barely even tracks well enough to summarize. In a way, the total breakdown is sort of beautiful; it's like watching the story collapse in upon itself, a deserted building, carefully demolished.",Netflix,77%,76%,68

14776,House of Cards,1,"Dealt that bad hand, the ""Cards"" writers have responded with a truncated final season -- one that elevates Robin Wright's role her new Commander in Chief status, while still providing a window into the world of bare-knuckled political brawling.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14777,House of Cards,0,"With or without Kevin Spacey, it's possible that House of Cards had simply run its course. It's just a shame that it couldn't make one final sprint toward the finish line.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14778,House of Cards,0,"The story picks up on the 4th of July, but it hardly feels like a birthday party with so much repetitive plotting and counterplotting going on.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14779,House of Cards,0,Season six is a web with no spider at the centre.,Netflix,77%,76%,68

14793,House of Cards,0,"Cards has always been a show whose plot contortions could confuse and whose incremental intrigue could bore, and those problems are worse now that everyone seems to be whispering.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14794,House of Cards,1,"House of Cards is off to a much better start this season, thanks in large part to the notable subtraction and subsequent elevation of its stars, but it is still very much House of Cards, different in good ways but still the same in the bad ones.",Netflix,77%,76%,68

14801,House of Cards,1,Following Robin Wright through this season as she reveals Claire slowly and deliberately is worth a binge.,Netflix,77%,76%,68
14802,House of Cards,1,"Season six feels like a return to form, from its increasingly complex subplots to its overarching story, and much of its success has to do with Gibson and Pugliese's willingness to fully exploit the more nostalgic aspects of the entire run.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14803,House of Cards,0,"It sounds like a compelling story, but Claire remains an icy, tough-to-read cipher through much of it, despite flashbacks to her childhood and that fourth-wall-breaking, talking-to-the-viewers thing that Spacey once did so well.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14804,House of Cards,1,"A closing chapter, without Spacey, allows the show its rightful final bow, unencumbered by scandal, and defined, in its finality, by a character far more complex and compelling than Spacey's Frank Underwood could ever have been.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14805,House of Cards,1,"As always with House of Cards, though, the particulars of the intrigue are not as important as the people behind it. One of the chief delights of this season is the showcase it gives to actresses in their midlife prime.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14806,House of Cards,1,"Cards maybe without its one-time King, but rather than folding, the creators have produced some real aces to deliver a winning, compelling, binge-worthy final hand.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14807,House of Cards,1,"Nevertheless, with the show ostensibly in Wright's capable hands, the final season of House of Cards gets by just fine without Francis J. Underwood, and there's reason to think it's even better off without him.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14808,House of Cards,1,"The one story line that towers over all others is the one about gender with Claire Underwood as president of the United States.. It makes the finale feel far more resonant, culturally important and compelling than I expected it to.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14809,House of Cards,1,"Ultimately I liked it, because it was revision of a series that I once enjoyed very much that had been tainted by the action of an actor and how the political climate evolved. It felt familiar and felt like a good way to end the show on its own terms.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14810,House of Cards,1,"As we saw last season, politics is faster than this now, an endless churn of scandal and grotesquery, and House Of Cards remains its own chilly, composed self.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14811,House of Cards,0,"In the moments when Claire is allowed not just the camera but the story, ""House of Cards"" is a ride; when the past is relitigated and the specter of Frank rears up once more, it feels like that worst thing a binge-able drama can be: a trudge.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14812,House of Cards,0,"Despite the hype, Season 6 isn't Claire's show. It's still Frank's, which undercuts the season's many attempts at women-first stories and keeps momentum stagnant.",Netflix,77%,76%,68

14815,House of Cards,1,"So House of Cards Season 6 is a must-watch. It's serving a bombastic, oversized, absurdist end to Netflix's first major original drama. And I'm okay with that.",Netflix,77%,76%,68

14820,House of Cards,1,"In its final season, the Netflix drama, which now has Robin Wright in the lead, is the best it's been in years.",Netflix,77%,76%,68
14821,House of Cards,1,Robin Wright is so damn good at playing this character that I really wish they had found a better way to showcase her talents. House of Cards was a great show that turned into a good one. This final season is good but could have been great.,Netflix,77%,76%,68

14830,Stay Close,0,"The trouble with Stay Close is that it's too familiar. Despite the plethora of unexpected twists, this series manages to feel identical to every other crime drama that's been thrown out in recent years, and not a particularly great one at that.",Netflix,92%,53%,13
14831,Stay Close,1,"See you for the next episode, plus the six after that - and there's no point pretending otherwise.",Netflix,92%,53%,13
14832,Stay Close,1,"""Stay Close"" builds its puzzle slowly, through subliminal editing of past violence and through the silences in what the characters don't say to each other - empty spaces that invite us to imagine what happened to these people all those years ago.",Netflix,92%,53%,13
14833,Stay Close,1,"But even by the well-established standards of these things, Stay Close is particularly bonkers, a lightning-fast, highly binge-able thriller that works mostly by sensory overload and never quite giving a straight answer. Happy New Year!",Netflix,92%,53%,13

14912,Sweet Tooth,1,"Frankly, Sweet Tooth is premiering at the right time. Even though some may roll their eyes at a story that kicks off with a pandemic and a lingering virus threat, we can all relate to this material in some way. It's the hope that sticks with you.",Netflix,97%,87%,73

14917,Bodyguard,1,"What the series creators, fully consciously of it or not, do show is a country ruled by vehemently anti-democratic and authoritarian cliques, none of whom would exhibit the slightest qualms about establishing openly dictatorial rule.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14918,Bodyguard,1,"Madden plays Budd like a time bomb poised to detonate, revealing a man scarred by his wartime experiences. Hawes is excellent as the hawkish politician and Mercurio keeps the twists coming through to the finale.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14919,Bodyguard,1,"She's older, upper class, English, and female; he's younger, working class, Scottish, and male. There's 50 shades of ""ma'am"" in the way he addresses her.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14920,Bodyguard,1,"While Bodyguard is being billed as a thriller, at its core it's that old favourite of the British isles, the police procedural - and crucially, even when it's just going through the procedures, it stays engaging.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14921,Bodyguard,0,Bodyguard adds to a long and damaging media trend of depicting brown people as terrorists.,Netflix,93%,84%,70
14922,Bodyguard,1,Six hours of a magnificent police drama. [Full Review in Spanish],Netflix,93%,84%,70
14923,Bodyguard,1,"The more ridiculous and far-fetched Bodyguard becomes, the more I am gripped.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14924,Bodyguard,1,"A taut limited series from the UK that will curl your hair; it is INTENSE. If you haven't seen it, hold a day to devote to six full length episodes on Netflix and expect to be deeply spooked.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14925,Bodyguard,0,"Unfortunately, full of filler where there should be thriller, Bodyguard just can't get the job done, literally or figuratively.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14926,Bodyguard,1,"The story takes wild, violent leaps amid myriad conspiracies, leading to a crazy, nail-biting climax that is both preposterous and wholly satisfying. Some binges feel like a slog. Bodyguard is more of a race, well worth the run.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14927,Bodyguard,1,The intense BBC drama didn't disappoint as it went out all guns blazing.,Netflix,93%,84%,70
14928,Bodyguard,1,"This has been a brilliant, compulsive, five-star mind trip of a series.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14929,Bodyguard,0,The result is a fatally broken series - it starts very well and goes off the rails in its last episodes - but it is blatantly visible that it offers the same discourse as the cinema of the 70s: the institutions are rotten. [Full Review in Spanish],Netflix,93%,84%,70
14930,Bodyguard,0,"After a few chapters, Bodyguard does something that is as bold as it is absurd, changing all the pieces of the game, but losing all cohesion. [Full review in Spanish]",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14931,Bodyguard,1,"Pure, can't-take-your-eyes away entertainment that's bound to have you saying ""just one more episode before bed."" This is sterling television, a well-crafted crime thriller, which is what the BBC does best.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14932,Bodyguard,1,It's had a tremendous critical reception... and virtually everyone who's mentioned it to me says it's brilliant. The opening definitely was; the rest of the episode wasn't quite at that level.,Netflix,93%,84%,70
14933,Bodyguard,1,"It's two things at once - the list of who did what and the reminder of what happened - and it feels nicely succinct. Like everything else about ""Bodyguard,"" including its hero, the opening is taut.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14934,Bodyguard,1,"The denouement is far too wordy and protracted, albeit peppered with some genuinely nail-biting moments. The show has earned your patience by this point, though, so you will gladly watch to the end.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14935,Bodyguard,1,Suspenseful political crime show is smart but violent.,Netflix,93%,84%,70

14938,Bodyguard,1,"The world of Bodyguard is all cynical shades of gray, where the best you can hope for is just to survive.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14939,Bodyguard,0,"It's a failed opportunity, and the result is a story that offers tantalizing threads of complexity, only to cut them all off right as they start combining into something truly innovative.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14940,Bodyguard,1,"After watching the entire series in one six-hour sitting, I get it. It made my heart race. It made me sweaty. I felt at times flush and lightheaded. And that was just Keeley Hawes.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14941,Bodyguard,1,"The series is ultimately Madden's, who handily proves he's capable of much, much more than brooding as King in the North.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14942,Bodyguard,1,"It helps that Madden looks like an old-fashioned action hero, but can embody the ideals of one, too, albeit with conflict and angst that feel distinctly contemporary.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14943,Bodyguard,1,The way these stories zero in on the morally compromised institutions responsible for individual suffering screams 2018...[Bodyguard] subverts thriller tropes just often enough to earn its reliance on them.,Netflix,93%,84%,70
14944,Bodyguard,1,"Bodyguard is a perfectly calibrated thriller that cleverly builds up the tension so you're always questioning what you see and hear, puzzling over everyone's motivations and real loyalties, and to hook you from beginning to end.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14945,Bodyguard,1,"Bodyguard remains a gripping and thoroughly entertaining adventure that's emotionally deft, but that clumsy ending dims its overall excellence.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14946,Bodyguard,1,Those are minor gripes given the thrill factor and how easily Bodyguard grabs your attention and doesn't relinquish it.,Netflix,93%,84%,70
14947,Bodyguard,1,"As Budd, Richard Madden is astonishing. His sweet good looks could have worked against the gravity of his role, but instead they give his tortured psychology a sympathetic appeal.",Netflix,93%,84%,70

14949,Bodyguard,1,"Bodyguard could unfold as a boilerplate political thriller, but the series defies expectations at every twist and turn-almost.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14950,Bodyguard,1,The end result is an engaging series that walks a very fine line between grounded political thriller and something far more outlandish.,Netflix,93%,84%,70

14955,Bodyguard,1,"There may be nothing groundbreaking about Bodyguard, but it's easy to see why it's breaking records. Like its politico-thriller forerunners, the show is taut entertainment for our time...",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14956,Bodyguard,1,"To watch Bodyguard's six episodes is to suspend disbelief and submit to its surprises. It helps not to expect too much more than that, particularly when it comes to the show's lavish employment of archetypes.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14957,Bodyguard,1,"One nagging plot hole doesn't detract from the momentum, and it's almost uncanny how deftly the series shifts the weight of the viewer's suspicions without coming off too tricksy. Good stuff.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14958,Bodyguard,1,"It can also be a blast, if you're all about the mystery and the forward momentum and your requirements for plausibility and psychological realism aren't high.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14959,Bodyguard,1,"The key resolution is that despite all the nefarious men populating the series, women were actually always the biggest power players in this political thriller.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14960,Bodyguard,1,"Bodyguard is bloody brilliant from the get-go. And if you watch, pay close attention to the terrorist who is tackled. It will be important later.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14961,Bodyguard,1,"Even when Bodyguard does get a bit over the top, that same British flair for understatement prevents it from feeling as ridiculous as it might in other hands.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14962,Bodyguard,1,"This enthralling thriller series should come with warnings about how anxiety-inducing it is, as well as how much you'll now want Richard Madden to play James Bond.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14963,Bodyguard,1,"More concerned with being a good ride than exploring character or politics, the show is awash in a timely cynicism.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14964,Bodyguard,1,"The action is well mounted and the tension tightly wound; it uncoils, when it does, with a satisfying snap.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14965,Bodyguard,1,"Both juicy in its delving into character psychology and rippingly ready to tear up its playbook as it goes, it's a six-episode ride that demands, and rewards, a quick binge.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14966,Bodyguard,1,"Bodyguard is a thriller first, and in respect to the elements that relate to the genre, the show masterfully excels. What makes it work is how well the show presents in the form of a slow-burn story despite moving at a rather quick stride.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14967,Bodyguard,1,"[Bodyguard is] one of those crowd-pleasing thrillers that manages to be both cerebral and terrible, where characters constantly do dumb things that leave you howling at the screen.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14968,Bodyguard,1,"Madden and Hawes have incredible chemistry, and like Madden, Hawes balances the public and private faces of her character with ease.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14969,Bodyguard,1,The plot makes up in symmetry what it may lack in believability.,Netflix,93%,84%,70

14971,Bodyguard,1,"The scripts are so gripping and suspenseful, once you've watched one episode, it's hard not to become hooked.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14972,Bodyguard,1,"Mercurio, the writer behind the gritty police procedural Line of Duty, has a way of bringing psychological complexity to the more outlandish pleasures of the thriller genre, and Bodyguard slaloms happily between the two.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14973,Bodyguard,1,Bodyguard...still might be the best thing Jed Mercurio has ever written.,Netflix,93%,84%,70

14977,Bodyguard,1,Bodyguard starts frenetic and stays there.,Netflix,93%,84%,70
14978,Bodyguard,1,"I can't wait to see what happens next. However, I do wonder about some of the casting. Though Madden can be rather wooden, that doesn't matter a jot here.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14979,Bodyguard,1,"In Bodyguard, Mercurio trains his eye and his nose for corruption on the corridors of power and, by the end of [the] opening episode, it was clear he has created something as dark and moreish as ever.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14980,Bodyguard,1,Bodyguard is an extremely successful production. Imagine it as a cross between The Thick of It and a Bond movie and you'll have the measure of it.,Netflix,93%,84%,70
14981,Bodyguard,1,"Besides the sharp scripting and deft direction, also key to hooking the audience here is Madden's rather revelatory performances.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14982,Bodyguard,1,All I can say is I already do not trust anyone in it - which is exactly what you want from a thriller.,Netflix,93%,84%,70
14983,Bodyguard,1,"Bodyguard is intelligent, psychological storytelling so gripping you'll have to remind yourself to breathe.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14984,Bodyguard,1,"Already it's a wild, thrilling ride. One thing is clear: Bodyguard is heading nowhere obvious.",Netflix,93%,84%,70
14985,Bodyguard,1,Richard Madden was spot-on as the inscrutable Budd.,Netflix,93%,84%,70
14986,Bodyguard,1,"It runs like explosive clockwork, and even when you know that the conversation has turned too damned quiet, the shock and awe of the ""maybe gunfire"" is irresistible.",Netflix,93%,84%,70

14988,"Web of Make Believe: Death, Lies & the Internet",0,While all of the subjects covered in the six episodes sound very interesting a lot of the oomph is taken out of them due to the repetitive and drawn out nature of each.,Netflix,--,47%,5
14989,"Web of Make Believe: Death, Lies & the Internet",1,"Viewers not as familiar with these online trends will find it both interesting and harrowing. Meanwhile, it also offers some important safety reminders for those who are actively engaging with others online.",Netflix,--,47%,5

14995,Teen Wolf,1,I'm a fan of a story that isn't tied up too neatly into a nice bow. Open ends mean the potential for a reunion movie down the line.,Hulu,81%,84%,12
14996,Teen Wolf,1,"You know, if you ignore all the problems with these final ten episodes - the lack of repercussions and overall pacing - then the finale is pretty good.",Hulu,81%,84%,12
14997,Teen Wolf,1,"It was both an ending and a new beginning, as the best series finales usually are, and it was beautiful.",Hulu,81%,84%,12
14998,Teen Wolf,1,"I really enjoyed Derek and Stiles' conflicting accounts of their South American adventures. I wish we'd gotten to see more from those two, but I understand there was a lot to squeeze into this episode.",Hulu,81%,84%,12
14999,Teen Wolf,0,"This finale felt like more of a cliffhanger than anything the show has done before, which is a strange choice when writing the series finale. I don't love knowing that there's a huge war to be fought and that's where all these people are going.",Hulu,81%,84%,12
15000,Teen Wolf,1,Almost everyone fans were hoping to see by series finale time have come home.,Hulu,81%,84%,12

15003,Teen Wolf,1,"Teen Wolf has earned the right to play with some daring stories and tricky emotions, and it does just that in an assured, streamlined final season.",Hulu,81%,84%,12
15004,Rick and Morty,0,Season 5 of Rick And Morty is worryingly uneven for the cartoon that breathed new life into the medium.,Hulu,94%,87%,22
15005,Rick and Morty,1,"It's all incredibly bleak, and somewhat shocking, but incredibly good TV while it lasts.",Hulu,94%,87%,22
15006,Rick and Morty,1,"""Mort Dinner Rick Andre"" isn't the kind of premiere that suggests a new direction for Rick and Morty -- as a matter of fact, it seems to confirm we're heading in the old one. But that's fine with me.",Hulu,94%,87%,22
15007,Rick and Morty,1,"It's Rick and Morty doing hacky action at its best to kick things off, and naturally, we wouldn't have it any other way.",Hulu,94%,87%,22
15008,Rick and Morty,1,"The opening salvo of the new season is spectacular: insane joke density, an ever-present silliness brushing up against bad taste, awkward social situations laid bare, and hilariously tearing classic sci-fi and genre conventions a new one.",Hulu,94%,87%,22
15009,Rick and Morty,1,"When a show's middle-of-the-road episode would be the highlight of another series, it is clear that the series has entered another echelon of television. It's no secret that Rick and Morty is in that echelon.",Hulu,94%,87%,22
15010,Rick and Morty,1,"""Mort Dinner Rick Andre"" is a solid season opener. No fills (though lots of fins). A few great lines mean the incoming Nimbus can now take a seat at the conversation concerning the show's best ever guest characters.",Hulu,94%,87%,22
15011,Rick and Morty,1,"Yes, Rick and Morty is as funny and sharp as ever. But this time around, Rick isn't in control.",Hulu,94%,87%,22
15012,Rick and Morty,1,"As season openers go, this is a really solid entry from Rick and Morty. Nimbus is an instantly memorable character and the Morty storyline is a reminder that Morty is capable of having hilarious adventures without Rick's direct involvement.",Hulu,94%,87%,22
15013,Rick and Morty,1,"Thanks to the guidance of creators Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland, the fifth season continues to develop while it blows our minds with new universes, timelines and TV-MA situations, making it more than just a sci-fi toon with the occasional dick joke.",Hulu,94%,87%,22
15014,Rick and Morty,1,"A tiny, almost throwaway plot detail can mutate into a gloriously surreal digression that threatens to overwhelm the main narrative. You find this in the best Simpsons episodes too, but I've rarely seen it done with more outrageous verve than it is here.",Hulu,94%,87%,22
15015,Rick and Morty,1,"The rapidity of the laughs and the rat-a-tat style of the whip-smart dialogue is sometimes dizzying, but what sets this apart from the similarly toned Family Guy is the jokes stay with the story.",Hulu,94%,87%,22
15016,Rick and Morty,1,It's a quite brilliant 22 minutes and one with an implicit moral.,Hulu,94%,87%,22
15017,Rick and Morty,1,"It's kooky, irreverent, innovative and fun... 'm curious to see where Season Five takes us.",Hulu,94%,87%,22
15018,Rick and Morty,1,The simultaneous fondness for the recurring motifs of speculative fiction and its irreverent mocking of twists and tools that have been done to death are central to this show's duende. And that's also a major reason we love Rick.,Hulu,94%,87%,22
15019,Rick and Morty,1,"""Mort Dinner Rick Andre"" is another functional Rick and Morty episode... But a functional Rick and Morty still guarantees you a lot of clever sci-fi tropes taken to extremes in creative ways, so, yeah, pretty good.",Hulu,94%,87%,22
15020,Rick and Morty,1,"The Season 5 premiere doesn't necessarily feel like a return to ""classic"" Rick and Morty, and nor does it feel like a dramatic departure. But the episode's straightforwardness... is a welcome shift.",Hulu,94%,87%,22
15021,Rick and Morty,1,"Rick and Morty persists not only for its inversion of sci-fi tropes, clever pop culture riffing and raw hilarity. It continues to hold our interest in a way few shows do because it knows we are all capable of great and terrible things.",Hulu,94%,87%,22
15022,Rick and Morty,1,"If ""Rick and Morty"" wants to toss in some more serialized stuff into Season 5 instead of trying to constantly outdo itself, that might be a way to keep this early momentum going.",Hulu,94%,87%,22
15023,Rick and Morty,1,"""Mort Dinner Rick Andre"" is a pleasant start to the new season, and a good reminder why we enjoy having these weirdos around.",Hulu,94%,87%,22
15024,Rick and Morty,1,"If not the biggest or most daring season premiere the series has delivered, ""Mort Dinner Rick Andre"" is nonetheless an enjoyable start to the new season.",Hulu,94%,87%,22
15025,Rick and Morty,1,"The premiere shows a lot of promise for the season as a whole. It's just as inventive as ever, and by not resetting the status quo, there's more room for character development.",Hulu,94%,87%,22
15026,Adventure Time,1,The Adventure Time finale is a must watch for any fan of the series. I have been there since the beginning and was very pleased with the outcome.,Hulu,100%,93%,14
15027,Adventure Time,1,"As heartbreaking, adventurous and inventive a conclusion as the show deserves.",Hulu,100%,93%,14
15028,Adventure Time,1,"Epic and uplifting, surreal and tragic, and true to the series and its viewers.",Hulu,100%,93%,14
15029,Adventure Time,1,"It focuses squarely on the warmth and attention to intimacy at the heart of Adventure Time, rather than dizzying spectacle or surreal humor.",Hulu,100%,93%,14
15030,Adventure Time,1,"No matter what monsters are faced externally or internally, this series has always delicately preached its message that we are stronger together. Adventure Time's finale is the epic actualization of that long-whispered message.",Hulu,100%,93%,14
15031,Adventure Time,1,Feels like a goodbye to Adventure Time with a bolded asterisk... The show's spirit is something that just can't come to an end.,Hulu,100%,93%,14
15032,Adventure Time,1,It was weird and sad and silly and funny and harrowing and so quietly profound I'll be thinking about it probably forever.,Hulu,100%,93%,14
15033,Adventure Time,1,"Adventure Time, thankfully, chooses the most elegant exit it can.",Hulu,100%,93%,14
15034,Adventure Time,1,"Most fan-service is bad, but this [finale] was good.",Hulu,100%,93%,14

15036,Adventure Time,1,"Come Along With Me has some of the elements you'd expect of a series finale. There's a wealth of callbacks to moments, catchphrases, and in-jokes from the whole history of the show.",Hulu,100%,93%,14
15037,Adventure Time,1,"More sensible to compare Adventure Time to Wicked or Sex and the City or Sopranos, these great cultural notions of (respectively) the good-evil paradigm or romance or masculinity deconstructed.",Hulu,100%,93%,14
15038,Adventure Time,1,"Even in the face of the apocalypse, that feeling endures, giving people a reason to keep living because they have a friend by their side.",Hulu,100%,93%,14

15044,The O.C.,0,A show that had so much juice seems to be running dry.,Hulu,67%,71%,17
15045,The O.C.,0,"Its peculiar mix of comic adult misbehavior, teen love and sexuality and sarcastic humor -- all played to a trendy musical soundtrack -- returns for a fourth season that illustrates it has stayed at the party too long.",Hulu,67%,71%,17
15046,The O.C.,0,It's easy to deduce how the characters of The O.C. spent their summer vacation. They were practicing jumping the shark. They have it down perfectly.,Hulu,67%,71%,17
15047,The O.C.,1,"Creator Josh Schwartz's writing came off like a light, sharp javelin, funny and wicked in all the right spots, and the cast was charismatic perfection.",Hulu,67%,71%,17
15048,The O.C.,0,The series used up three times as much plot as any other drama around. It burned through whole arcs of character development in one episode and started repeating itself.,Hulu,67%,71%,17

15186,Atlanta,1,Atlanta is undeniably great television that delivers what fans have come to love about the series while still pushing the boundaries of what the show can be.,Hulu,97%,82%,32
15187,Atlanta,1,"Atlanta remains one of TV's most distinctive shows, if not the most distinctive, artistically ambitious show of its era. It's hilarious, disturbing, sad, and silly all at once, and is unafraid to challenge its audience.",Hulu,97%,82%,32

15189,Fargo,1,"The first half of this opening episode was just tremendous, although I did feel the second drifted a bit.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15190,Fargo,1,"Given that Fargo has always stood out, it is strange that it seems to be settling for blending in.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15191,Fargo,1,"Fargo has returned still smarter and slicker than the majority of crime dramas out there. But for those who've seen the series reinvent itself to great success twice already, this may feel like one do-over too many.",Hulu,93%,84%,56

15196,Fargo,1,"Playing the game only gets Black people so far, and others near society's bottom rung enjoy feeling superior to them. The season isn't a failure, but the swing Fargo took would have connected if it utilized a better way of communicating this.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15197,Fargo,1,Fargo's fourth saga [is] both timely and a satisfying view of the American dream as a flawed fable.,Hulu,93%,84%,56
15198,Fargo,1,"There's no show like it on TV, and no better time than now to catch up.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15199,Fargo,1,"Fargo wouldn't be Fargo without snow, a lot of blood dripping on the snow, and very bad baddies beaten... But, on top of that, this season has become almost Lorca. [Full Review in Spanish]",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15200,Fargo,1,"With beautiful transitions and some of the best camerawork the series has ever shown, Fargo continues to be a series that redefines not only itself but what makes television great.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15201,Fargo,0,"While Hawley's effort is admirable, and the performances from the cast keep the show at least watchable, most of what happens throughout the season, unfortunately, feels monotone.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15202,Fargo,1,"Thanks to solid writing and a fantastic cast, all of the major characters are well defined and have a presence that helps the audience feel invested right away.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15203,Fargo,1,"It is ambitious, slick, and ponderous, carefully lining up dominoes for a spectacular collapse, but never illuminating anything a student of the gangster epics doesn't already know.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15204,Fargo,1,"Fargo is Fargo; you'll get excellent and unexpected performances, a lot of quirk, a lot of violence, and a lot of fascinating side stories.",Hulu,93%,84%,56

15206,Fargo,1,Chris Rock has finally found a dramatic role worthy of his considerable talents.,Hulu,93%,84%,56
15207,Fargo,1,"Buckley's daft performance is the star turn of a very talented cast. Evaluating the rest of the show, however, is more difficult, particularly its attempt to establish a moral footing for itself.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15208,Fargo,1,"Back for its fourth season, the important good news is this iteration of Fargo is significantly better than the disappointing third season, though probably not as good as the near-perfect second season.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15209,Fargo,1,"It may not be the show's most exciting season, but in the longer term, it may be the most important.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15210,Fargo,1,"Series creator Noah Hawley has come up with yet another ambitious, dazzling, and entertaining season of his Coen brothers-based anthology series, this time with a story that brings in themes of racism, assimilation, and the fraught promise of America.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15211,Fargo,1,"Incredibly ambitious, at times outrageously inventive and breathtaking, Noah Hawley's Coen Brothers-inspired anthology series is back with a bang.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15212,Fargo,1,"It's the most epic-scaled season of Fargo yet, and while it has sprawling-story problems, it's always riveting.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15213,Fargo,1,"Buckley has marked herself out as one of the leading lights of her generation. On the evidence so far, this is her finest performance yet.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15214,Fargo,1,"Is it bad? Not exactly. But it is kind of dull, and what's striking is how tentatively the new season seems to be willing to engage in those few elements of its setting that are unique.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15215,Fargo,0,"If all of this sounds like a lot of strands to tie together, it is-but unlike in previous seasons, many of these strands really feel ancillary to the gangland drama that stodgily occupies center stage.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15216,Fargo,1,"Season 4 is a sharp enough break to restore faith in Fargo as a concept. Whatever else it may be, this new story isn't inert. And after such a moribund Season 3, it's strong evidence the well hasn't run dry just yet.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15217,Fargo,0,"The characters tend to be as thin as the story they inhabit, though, and vivid performers like Buckley and Esposito (of the Italian gangster series ""Gomorrah"") can't do much with the cartoons they've been given to play.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15218,Fargo,1,"Like this nation, the new season is a beautiful and ugly, inspiring and infuriating, a tragic and sometimes darkly hilarious mess. As frustrating as it often was to watch, I couldn't look away.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15219,Fargo,0,"Outsize characterizations are not new for ""Fargo,"" but a balance has been lost here, with many characters standing in for the grandest sorts of evil and too few giving us what the series at its best possesses - soulfulness.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15220,Fargo,1,"Hawley has more than proved that he's a worthy foe of tropes and cliches, but here, his vision can at times feel detrimentally self-indulgent... What does work here, at times terrifically, is the complete shift in setting.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15221,Fargo,0,"When one character asks a question of another and then announces with a self-regarding smirk that it was rhetorical... Fargo disappears into its own navel, where even the lint is annotated.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15222,Fargo,1,"Fargo, as in past seasons, manages to be both more dramatic, and more comic, than almost any other show on TV right now.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15223,Fargo,1,"The series' fourth season is both a welcome return to form and a compelling, cinematic vision of the so-called American dream gone to rot.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15224,Fargo,1,"Chris Rock brings the pain - and the menace - in an ambitious, mobbed-up period piece...",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15225,Fargo,0,"Too often, though, the narrative moves at a crawl, filled with long conversations that carry the impending threat of violence.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15226,Fargo,1,"This series retains its wonky history, often philosophical humour, outstanding characters and exploration into the wonders of human behaviour.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15227,Fargo,1,"Rock dives into the material and adds emotional gravitas. His charisma as a performer creates comedic elements with ease, but he never loses sight of the stakes.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15228,Fargo,1,"If you've stuck with ""Fargo"" this long and over the years haven't been turned away by the freewheeling nature of its story or the quirky characters which inhabit the narrative, than season 4 will prove just as rewarding.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15229,Fargo,0,"Fargo has always been a little off-kilter, but those elements stand out as particularly indulgent or egregious this season, when its overall storytelling approach is so uneven.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15230,Fargo,1,"You practically need a map, the series is so all over the place. But frustrations and all, it's a journey worth taking.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15231,Fargo,1,. It feels like Hawley is going less for the quirky black humor of the first three seasons and more for the tone of what was seen in the Coen's early serious films.,Hulu,93%,84%,56
15232,Fargo,1,"Clearly Hawley needed to get out of Minnesota to recharge his batteries, but maybe it's time to leave the Coen sandbox for good.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15233,Fargo,1,"The Coen Brothers make movies about quirky characters, but it would be nice if Noah Hawley and the team behind the Fargo TV series would remember that there's more to those movies than the quirk.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15234,Fargo,1,"The sprawling set of characters gives the story an appropriate epic scope, which is a new approach for the series, and makes this season feel fresh, even if it's operating in a well-established genre.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15235,Fargo,1,"Even when it isn't peak Fargo and despite being weighted down by ambitions that aren't fully realized thus far, there are sweeping swathes of greatness here.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15236,Fargo,0,"Fargo has lost its footing in Season 4, succumbing to stylization and caricature and gratuitous over-plotting, and effectively wasting a tremendous cast. We're left with a weak story and a few banal monologues about race, money, and Life In America.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15237,Fargo,1,"Like America itself, Fargo is a dizzying, delightful swirl of influences. And this move away from the series' familiar Minnesota home turf is mostly a rollicking success.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15238,Fargo,1,A season of television that struggles to feel cohesive but does deliver some stand-out moments and fantastic characters.,Hulu,93%,84%,56
15239,Fargo,1,"Fargo has always been good, from the very beginning, against odds so long you could wrap them around the earth like a lasso. None of that changes here. I can't wait to see how the rest of this rumpus hashes itself out.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15240,Fargo,1,Season 4 is feeling a bit like diminishing returns. Which is not to say the show is at all bad; it's still fun to watch and exceptionally well-made. It just doesn't feel as vital as it once did.,Hulu,93%,84%,56
15241,Fargo,1,"With a strong point of view, impeccable scenery and sharp acting (as usual), it's easy to forgive a rather slow start.",Hulu,93%,84%,56
15242,Fargo,1,"Another exemplary cast elevates wordless gestures and already witty lines into exciting entertainment, with Jessie Buckley and Glynn Turman being the overall breakouts, but this version of Fargo feels bleaker than any that preceded it.",Hulu,93%,84%,56

15245,Attack on Titan,1,"Shishido's direction did not manage to communicate so eloquently the increasingly complex narrative, although the fault lies at least as much on the original material. The one thing he does pretty well, however, is bring all the storylines together",Hulu,96%,95%,3
15246,Attack on Titan,1,"Te final season's premiere continues Attack on Titan's deft focus on the no-win hell that is war, and while fans may miss those familiar faces, the new additions to the cast and their side of the story are sure to impress.",Hulu,96%,95%,3

15248,Killing Eve,0,"Instead of something small but perfectly formed, Killing Eve has become one of those programmes that seems mainly to inspire the response, “Oh are they still making that?”",Hulu,89%,73%,31
15249,Killing Eve,1,"Season 4 ignores some of the emotional progress made in its predecessor and theres no indication in the first few episodes as to why Eve and Villanelle are once again at odds with each other, or what happened to the tenderness displayed on the bridge.",Hulu,89%,73%,31
15250,Killing Eve,0,"From the first time Jodie Comer pressed a knife to Sandra Oh’s throat, the sexy murder drama seemed to promise one thing. Frustrated fans are right to be disappointed.",Hulu,89%,73%,31
15251,Killing Eve,0,"Weve grown accustomed to queer characters dying on screen, especially ones in relationships. Keeping these women apart for the majority of the series, giving the characters (and fans) what they want, and then ripping it away is such a tired trope.",Hulu,89%,73%,31

15254,Killing Eve,1,"From the moment I heard the dulcet tones of Jodie Comer’s ­assassin Villanelle singing like an angel, in complete choir girl garb, I fell in love with Killing Eve all over again.",Hulu,89%,73%,31
15255,Killing Eve,0,I think most will be disappointed at how far from the first two seasons this series has gone and be thankful that they wont be dragging it out much longer.,Hulu,89%,73%,31
15256,Killing Eve,0,This one’s over. It’s done.,Hulu,89%,73%,31
15257,Killing Eve,0,"Groundbreaking when it began, the caper starring Jodie Comer and Sandra Oh as cat and mouse, should probably have ended a couple of seasons back. What started as Tom and Jerry now resembles the complicated romance in Krazy Kat.",Hulu,89%,73%,31
15258,Killing Eve,1,There is something lovely about episodes that don’t include so much upheaval. But there’s also a restlessness to the writing and editing that feels uncomfortable with just letting its characters be.,Hulu,89%,73%,31
15259,Killing Eve,1,"With an attachment as twisted and complex at its center, Killing Eve can only aim its sights on a finale that ends with a bang rather than merely a whimper.",Hulu,89%,73%,31
15260,Killing Eve,0,"With only eight episodes in the series, it’s time to stop idling and hit the gas pedal. And new characters and errant plot threads only hinder what should be the driving force of the series, namely the Eve and Villanelle relationship.",Hulu,89%,73%,31

15262,Killing Eve,1,"Comer is still on good form and Oh remains as mesmerising as ever. But, in spite of some good jokes, you do struggle to see the point of it all.",Hulu,89%,73%,31
15263,Killing Eve,1,"The programme is entertaining, and no viewer will regret spending an hour or two with it. But it’s hard not to expect and want something more from a project with this calibre of performers; it shouldn’t just be “fine”.",Hulu,89%,73%,31
15264,Killing Eve,1,"Now, in season 4, Eve, played by Sandra Oh, is once again the focus of the show, and it’s so much better for it.",Hulu,89%,73%,31

15269,Killing Eve,1,"Familiar pleasures are still pleasures, and Killing Eve is nothing if not indulgent.",Hulu,89%,73%,31

15271,Killing Eve,0,Comer and Oh do their damnedest to save scripts that appear to have a surface-level engagement with the central conflicts of the series.,Hulu,89%,73%,31
15272,Killing Eve,1,"When they do come into contact, the chemistry that Oh and Comer show off is, as always, palpable. Purposefully banal scenes and simple discussions become infused with an intensity that few other acting couples can produce on screen.",Hulu,89%,73%,31
15273,Killing Eve,0,"Like a bad romance, Killing Eve is keeping its couple apart without logical or emotional justification. In the process, it’s dulled the spark provided by these two excellent actors as well as the tension sustained by their taste for danger.",Hulu,89%,73%,31
15274,Killing Eve,0,"Ever since the series’ first season, Killing Eve has been stuck in a weird holding pattern when it comes to these characters... And in the final season, don’t we -- and these characters -- deserve more?",Hulu,89%,73%,31

15277,Killing Eve,1,"Villanelle and Eve’s relationship is the heart, soul, and backbone of Killing Eve, a fact reinforced in Season 4. You better believe I am rooting for Villaneve to end up with a nice life, cool flat, fun job, and to watch movies together.",Hulu,89%,73%,31

15285,Taboo,0,"As a showcase for Hardy's considerable acting chops, Taboo is passable, but once you peel away [Tom] Hardy's detailed performance you begin to realize that there's almost nothing to the character he's playing.",Hulu,76%,92%,67
15286,Taboo,1,"The formula of the show is well set: uncanny impressions, relentless passive aggression and a surprising amount of pathos, this time all soused in vino tinto.",Hulu,76%,92%,67
15287,Taboo,1,"If you could fathom what Hardy was growling, Delaney's closing run-in with Jonathan Pryce's East India Company boss suddenly put things on a knife-edge, promising just the sort of conflict you'd return for.",Hulu,76%,92%,67
15288,Taboo,1,"I want to be kind about the series because it looked fantastic. It had, as I say, great lines. There has not been such a blissful collective display of character acting for a while: the best supporting actor gong goes to the lot of them.",Hulu,76%,92%,67
15289,Taboo,1,"For not giving up on historical dramas, even if not perfecting the genre, Tom Hardy's Taboo deserves your attention. Give it some.",Hulu,76%,92%,67
15290,Taboo,1,"At the very least, with all the period detailing and potential for Back-Stabbing and Lies, it's filling the Game of Thrones void. And, seriously. Tom Hardy. Watch it for him alone. He's spectacular.",Hulu,76%,92%,67

15299,Taboo,1,"Even at its most borderline-comically intense, Taboo remains watchable because Hardy (and supporting standouts Oona Chaplin, David Hayman and Jonathan Pryce) simply bewitches us into believing it's watchable.",Hulu,76%,92%,67

15307,Taboo,1,"How you feel about Taboo probably depends on how gothic you like your historical dramas to be. Personally I'm a fan of period pieces stuffed full of doom, gloom and melodrama and served with side dishes of long-stewing revenge and simmering violence.",Hulu,76%,92%,67

15322,Taboo,1,"This is clearly an obsessive, personal work, and it's intriguing on that level - more so if you're a fan of Tom Hardy, who has become the most exciting example of the Miserablist school of acting.",Hulu,76%,92%,67

15467,Normal People,1,"Much braver, more open and realistic than most teen romances. These Irish lovers share their intellect and soulfulness, but not much else. It is in how they approach their differences and the secrets of their past that the series soars.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15468,Normal People,1,"While most will-they-or-won't-they romances feel trite by design, Normal People excels in its subtlety.",Hulu,91%,93%,89

15471,Normal People,1,"Hulu's Normal People is a rare television series that focuses on romance as its core, rather than a byproduct of the actual plot.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15472,Normal People,1,"No doubt some will accuse Normal People of wallowing in teen angst, but to me it rings absolutely true, and is beautifully done.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15473,Normal People,1,Normal People emerged as a naturalistic masterclass in emotional depth and cerebral elegance.,Hulu,91%,93%,89
15474,Normal People,1,"Take away all the dynamic storytelling and so-real-it-hurts humanity, and you're still left with a steamy quarantine binge that'll leave your heart racing in the best way.",Hulu,91%,93%,89

15479,Normal People,1,"On the surface, the show might end by suggesting a brighter future, but that one glancing note of positivity can't override the overwhelming feeling evoked by the series.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15480,Normal People,1,The lovely and realistic 12-part series benefits from the unnuanced performances by Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal.,Hulu,91%,93%,89

15482,Normal People,1,Normal People is a romance epic that miraculously manages to escape its youthful roots and evolve into something deeply thoughtful and life-affirming.,Hulu,91%,93%,89
15483,Normal People,1,"More striking is the series' steady, unhurried pacing and its willingness to examine the weight of memory and regret. The series' insistent quietude either seduces you immediately or leaves one cold.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15484,Normal People,1,"Normal People is its most real at these moments, when it shows how coming from a wealthy family gives you an advantage in college.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15485,Normal People,1,"Edgar-Jones brings a mesmerising vulnerability, while Mescal (in his breakout role) muddles the words in his mouth before he speaks, taking great care with the dialogue that Rooney uses so sparingly.",Hulu,91%,93%,89

15487,Normal People,1,"It is the very ordinariness of Normal People, though, that makes it an unmissable small screen treasure, an achingly everyday love story in which we might find, reflected, pieces of our own.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15488,Normal People,1,"It's a beautifully done series about love, sex, and class in Ireland that features a pair of indelible lead performances.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15489,Normal People,0,The result is hardly incompetent but never bold enough to transcend the standard literary adaptation.,Hulu,91%,93%,89
15490,Normal People,1,"Handled the way it is, the physical becomes an intellectual tool and a window into character. That the people involved are very beautiful doesn't hurt, of course. But viewers will ultimately love Normal People for its mind.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15491,Normal People,1,I've never seen a love story like it on television before.,Hulu,91%,93%,89

15494,Normal People,1,"Missing, still, however, is the inherent messiness of two teenagers in love. There's certainly plenty to admire in the production's lacquer. But it makes it harder to see the flesh-and-blood youths on the other side.",Hulu,91%,93%,89

15498,Normal People,1,"All of this is extremely faithful to the novel. The big difference is the series's tone and willingness to live in its feelings... I found it all moving and emotionally wrecking, in the best way.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15499,Normal People,0,"We were shown banal locations and left to guess what was going on in the characters' minds as they stumbled for words or stared out of windows. That can work in a novel, with its internal monologues, but not on television.",Hulu,91%,93%,89

15502,Normal People,1,"Above all, Normal People is an open-hearted drama, brimming with optimism, pain, despair, and rapturous joy. Much like the novel, this story gets under your skin, goes straight to your heart, and buries itself deep.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15503,Normal People,1,"Both Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal are compelling here: the long gaps in their conversations crackling with complicated and unresolved emotions; sudden, surprising smiles making you catch your breath.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15504,Normal People,1,Bear with it and you will not be disappointed as the world director Lenny Abrahamson and his fellow producers create is just as compelling as its two leads.,Hulu,91%,93%,89
15505,Normal People,1,"The series is bolstered throughout by engaging performances from both Edgar-Jones and Mescal, who breathe life into a story that is hyper-focused on what's often left unsaid between two people.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15506,Normal People,1,"To have it shown instead of told refreshes the story for those who already know it, and will surely help engage those who are alienated by such interior detailing.",Hulu,91%,93%,89

15510,Normal People,1,"By keeping the camera tight, director Lenny Abrahamson allows us to see every emotion, perfectly capturing the intensity of youthful love.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15511,Normal People,0,"The beauty of the novel is that so much between its protagonists is left unsaid, but perhaps it might have been better if the BBC had left the literary version of Normal People to speak for itself.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15512,Normal People,1,"The show finds emotional power in its finely modulated lead performances, which have ample room to unfold. The effects are sneaky, cumulative, dependent on your willingness to agonize with the characters across four years and a series of sloppy partings.",Hulu,91%,93%,89

15514,Normal People,1,"The 12-episode adaptation... is so faithful to the letter of the novel (Rooney co-wrote the first six scripts) that it winds up being different in spirit-swoonier, not that swoony is a bad thing.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15515,Normal People,1,"Normal People is beautifully acted, atmospheric and sharply detailed. Six whole hours, though, feels like a stretch.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15516,Normal People,1,"Hulu's Normal People is a vivid and intimate look at young, messy love, anchored by two powerfully vulnerable performances.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15517,Normal People,1,Normal People will punch you in the gut just as much as it embraces you in a hug.,Hulu,91%,93%,89
15518,Normal People,1,"Matching the compulsive page-turning quality of Rooney's novel, this 12-part TV romance is anything but normal.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15519,Normal People,1,"The two young leads are suberb; Mescal in particular is a revelation and gives a rich, thoughtful performance, particularly in some very intimate scenes.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15520,Normal People,1,"With its trifecta of elegant writing, directing, and acting, Hulu's Normal People is just as bleak and uncompromising as Rooney's novel -- a feat, and one that takes several episodes to fully absorb.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15521,Normal People,1,"Normal People is not the second coming of Dawson's Creek... But there's a sweet, silly soapiness to this show that makes it all the more appealing to get lost in.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15522,Normal People,0,"Their love story is sweet, with many truthful moments of beauty and heartache... But despite the long timespan of the series' events, the characters' emotional arcs move at a much slower pace and become lost in the minutiae.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15523,Normal People,1,"""Normal People"" could be the first work in Rooney's ""Before"" trilogy, another epic and intimate romance built around an undeniable, impractical spark. After all, it may have been done before, but it hasn't been told like this.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15524,Normal People,1,"Of the show's two young stars, much is asked, and even more is given. They are spectacular -- apart, but especially together -- at conveying the vulnerability and longing essential to making a love story like this work.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15525,Normal People,1,"The adaptation would always live or die by the casting of the leads... Happily, they are unassailable. Edgar-Jones and Mescal inhabit Marianne and Connell so utterly that it is instantly impossible to imagine them being played by anyone else.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15526,Normal People,0,"Beyond illustrating the angst of their mutual attraction with a thousand penetrating angles, Normal People's TV adaptation fails as both an adaptation and as a standalone show. Without the details of the book, the story is featureless erotica.",Hulu,91%,93%,89
15527,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"So far, its final season is very funny, and its certainly rewarding for longtime fans. Most importantly, its also growing, changing, and asking tough questions about its own premise up until the very last moment.",Hulu,95%,87%,28
15528,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"With one last caper, the wacky precinct that stole our hearts and tickled our funny bones signed off after eight seasons on two networks. As Jake would say: Noice.",Hulu,95%,87%,28

15530,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,0,"The final season was a chance for the show to engage in some systemic critique; its attempts to do so, however, largely fell flat... A soft-pedaled version of policing and the people who do it.",Hulu,95%,87%,28
15531,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"It was a warm-hearted, densely crafted comedy that was one of the networks' last decent originals. Fortunately, the two-part finale did the series justice, and you should check it out if you were ever a fan.",Hulu,95%,87%,28
15532,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,0,"There will surely be some watchable gags... but between the consistently uncertain run and a world that has seen such a substantial shift in mindset, it's safe to say that viewers are more than ready to say goodbye.",Hulu,95%,87%,28
15533,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"""The Last Day"" is far from Brooklyn Nine-Nine's finest hour, but it deserves credit for checking off every series finale box while telling a fun story without going overboard on saccharine material.",Hulu,95%,87%,28
15534,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"For a show that has always been enviably confident in its comedic tone, the start of Brooklyn Nine-Nine Season 8 falters, but not without showing its potential.",Hulu,95%,87%,28
15535,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,It somehow manages to be topical and ridiculous; on-trend and off-kilter.,Hulu,95%,87%,28

15539,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"Season 8 of Brooklyn Nine-Nine wasn't the triumphant victory lap that it should have been, but ""The Last Day"" absolutely sends off our favorite precinct with grace, humor, and heart.",Hulu,95%,87%,28
15540,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"Ultimately, the series finale delivered on everything we've come to expect from Brooklyn Nine-Nine: plenty of humor, plenty of heart, and a soulful and satisfying farewell to a warm and wonderful series. NINE-NINE!",Hulu,95%,87%,28

15543,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"There's not a lot of runway left before the end of the series but if anyone is able to thoughtfully balance the big questions with the demands of a weekly comedy, it's going to be the Brooklyn Nine-Nine writers.",Hulu,95%,87%,28
15544,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,[Provides] a parade of comedy while also leaning into serious socio-political issues. It deftly navigates this tricky balance all while making sure each character remains true to their own personalities and motivations.,Hulu,95%,87%,28

15547,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"I don't want to applaud the show for doing the right thing, but more so for ditching the work they'd done thus far in favor of a story that really examines the police and its role in society.",Hulu,95%,87%,28
15548,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"While culturally relevant, ""The Good Ones"" and Brooklyn Nine-Nine's approach to what's going on in the world kind of implode upon themself, thanks to the previous seven seasons of the series.",Hulu,95%,87%,28
15549,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"Brooklyn Nine-Nine does the best job possible of acknowledging the problem with portraying cops as uncomplicated heroes while still remaining a good-natured, funny show, but it feels fitting, and fortunate, that this is its final season.",Hulu,95%,87%,28

15554,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,I'm happy that a sitcom that's delivered so many hard laughs over the years has had the chance to go out on its own terms - nudging its audience toward a greater awareness of what other cop shows are trying to sell in the process.,Hulu,95%,87%,28

15566,Legion,1,"Its final season premiere advances the plot while swimming in pure psychedelia. Trippy but not senseless... the real fun is in deciphering the plot puzzles, verbal games and visual clues as the storyline hurtles towards finally doing some time travel.",Hulu,91%,86%,27
15567,Legion,1,"The loopy digressions are as vivid as ever... But there's also solid character development, inventive depictions of mutant powers, a delightful bit of mime from Bill Irwin and at least one genuine narrative surprise.",Hulu,91%,86%,27
15568,Legion,0,"PowerPoint surrealism hiding a total lack of imagination. Deaths don't matter, as the timeline fractures across illusions and flashbacks. There's yet another toothy shadow monster. David's face appears on lunchboxes: Mmmm, yessss, ironic merchandise.",Hulu,91%,86%,27

15602,Justified,1,"The greatest compliment I can pay Justified is to say that, despite the fact that it arrived at the height of the anti-hero boom, it never felt like a copycat. The drama created a vibrant, funny, tragic world of its own.",Hulu,97%,95%,25
15603,Justified,1,There must be an alternate universe where Justified is fully recognized for what it is: one of the greatest shows in television history.,Hulu,97%,95%,25

15605,Justified,1,"With ""Fate,"" as usual, the best stuff with Justified is often the little stuff: a stray word of dialogue, an Olyphant glance from under the shadow of that Stetson Marshall hat, Goggins' hair. Oh yes, the hair.",Hulu,97%,95%,25
15606,Justified,1,One of the great things about this noir-western hybrid is its interest in updating more than just the superficial tropes of those genres.,Hulu,97%,95%,25
15607,Prison Break,1,This season promises plenty of action in some real-world parallels...,Hulu,61%,78%,34
15608,Prison Break,1,"I was fascinated the entire time and thought there were a great amount of plot twists. There was a character for everyone. No one was quite like the other, which definitely added to the beauty of this show.",Hulu,61%,78%,34

15610,Prison Break,0,"The reality is that Prison Break in 2017 is basically a collection of ideas that Homeland passed on, if you can imagine that.",Hulu,61%,78%,34
15611,Prison Break,1,"Moving the action to Yemen and a city thrown into chaos by ISIL made the show relevant, if not far-fetched. You do wonder how far realistically Lincoln would get in his search, but you care enough about the characters to let it slide.",Hulu,61%,78%,34
15612,Prison Break,1,"For a 45-minute blast of nostalgia or a bit of (literal) escapism, Prison Break does the job. Just make sure you've suspended your disbelief before you watch.",Hulu,61%,78%,34
15613,Prison Break,1,Solid series revival is true to the original crime story.,Hulu,61%,78%,34

15615,Prison Break,1,"Prison Break is a very special roller coaster ride that lives by its own rules, and not much seems to have changed from the franchise's later seasons. That's a good thing for fans of the original, but for everyone else? I'm not sure.",Hulu,61%,78%,34
15616,Prison Break,0,This was most definitely not the way I wanted nor expected season five to get underway. But here's hoping somehow the show is able to catch its footing because Ogygia was a complete and utter letdown.,Hulu,61%,78%,34
15617,Prison Break,0,"As is so often the case, creating buzz worthy content doesn't necessarily translate into content that justifies its existence beyond causing a stir. That's largely how Prison Break feels.",Hulu,61%,78%,34
15618,Prison Break,0,"Prison Break isn't worth much of anything, but it could have been. You can see the better show trying to escape its lock-up of bad ideas.",Hulu,61%,78%,34
15619,Prison Break,1,"But while TV in general has changed, Prison Break really hasn't, as seen in tonight's season premiere. Billed as an event series, the show remains true to its goofy nature, with just a few surprises thrown into the mix.",Hulu,61%,78%,34

15624,Prison Break,0,The nostalgia works against the show.,Hulu,61%,78%,34
15625,Prison Break,0,"More than a new installment of Prison Break, this season feels a bit like Homeland For Dummies, with the political intrigue and intelligence-community backstabbing brought down to a grade-school level.",Hulu,61%,78%,34
15626,Prison Break,0,"This show was junk food, and proud of it. That's what makes Prison Break's return as a nine-episode miniseries so baffling: Now, the show wants to mean something. And it's horrible.",Hulu,61%,78%,34
15627,Prison Break,0,"Fox's revival, alas, begins with a flawed blueprint, while suffering from a been-there, broke-out-of-that quality.",Hulu,61%,78%,34

15630,Prison Break,1,"With the action going from 0 to 80 m.p.h. about 10 minutes into the premiere, this Prison Break wants to recapture its old urgency -- and some of its old fans will likely stick around for the ride.",Hulu,61%,78%,34
15631,Prison Break,1,It may take a little while to get going but trust me; it's worth the wait. By the end you'll be wishing you could binge watch the whole season on Netflix.,Hulu,61%,78%,34
15632,Prison Break,1,"At its best, Prison Break is kind of the Fast & Furious of episodic television -- not taking itself too seriously and providing equal amounts of crazy plot twists, action sequences and cheesy dialogue.",Hulu,61%,78%,34
15633,Prison Break,1,"Although the Prison Break revival came close several times to self-parody, the reunion of Lincoln, Michael, Sara, and the rest of the original characters had enough power to carry the show through its sillier moments.",Hulu,61%,78%,34

15637,Prison Break,1,"After seeing all the badass brawls and jaw-dropping shocks that happen in the early part of the season, I'd have to be behind bars to stop from watching everything else that happens. I need answers as badly as Linc does.",Hulu,61%,78%,34

15639,Prison Break,1,"Everyone from the writers to the actors committed to the outlandish nature of the show's later years, and this is where the newest run of episodes squarely lives... and unlike The X-Files, this conspiracy is fun to watch.",Hulu,61%,78%,34
15640,Prison Break,1,"Prison Break is at its best when it's an escapist jaunt graced with a few characters and relationships with energy and texture, but the drama finds it quite difficult to establish that groove this time out.",Hulu,61%,78%,34
15641,Community,1,Community is unique. There has never been a sitcom quite like it.,Hulu,88%,88%,37
15642,Community,0,"The last season of Community was really, truly awful. I mean, it crashed and burned. And for a show as self-aware as this one, there's no way it didn't know it.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15643,Community,1,"There's no denying that the magic of the early seasons isn't quite there. However, let's be very clear about this: There is much greatness and joy to be found in those 13 episodes.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15644,Community,1,"It's meta, but one of the best things about Community is how it finds sincere emotion lurking in its self-deconstructive rabbitholes.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15645,Community,1,"There's no obvious evidence of budget cuts in the move to Yahoo, so consider this a positive start for the latest version of Community.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15646,Community,1,"It looks mighty twee on the page, but as Community fans know, Mr. Harmon has a knack for turning countercultural whimsicality into affecting, fast-paced comedy. He pulls it off again.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15647,Community,1,"Really, they're just great excuses for fans to geek out on what they love most about Community, from the endless stream of nostalgic pop culture references to the clever inside jokes about the show itself.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15648,Community,1,"The spirit largely remains intact: Specifically, the world is mad. So is Greendale. So is Dan Harmon. Did I say I love Paget Brewster? I do. And the refurbished, reborn, reconstituted, regenerated, re-undead Community? That too.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15649,Community,1,"For all intents and purposes, this technologically resurrected Community still feels like Community, just, you know, a little different.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15650,Community,1,"The series feels truly smaller for the first time... That said, the extra time allows for funny gags to go on longer as well.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15651,Community,1,"A fitting farewell for the folks of Greendale, as the entire series perfectly collapsed in on itself in a glorious, hilarious, and bittersweet fashion.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15652,Community,1,"Good show, Yahoo.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15653,Community,1,"Like the Greendale Seven themselves, our time at Community college may not have seemed like the complete fulfillment of Dan Harmon's dream, but an invaluable experience that brought such unlikely friends together.",Hulu,88%,88%,37

15659,Community,1,"Though it will never be quite whole again, I'm happy Community is back.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15660,Community,1,"The Yahoo version of Community seems rather scaled-down, budget-wise, and looser and less urgent than NBC seasons (running times vary). But it still feels, moves, and thinks like the Community you know.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15661,Community,1,"Welcome back, Community. Even on Yahoo, you're still the best sitcom on network television.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15662,Community,1,"Community loves nothing more than pushing back against traditional industry standards, an impulse that shows no sign of abating in this strange sixth season.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15663,Community,1,"Brewster is a versatile comic actress with a great feel for blasts of absurdity, and she quickly proves to be a great fit for Community's tendency to whip back and forth between banter comedy and straight-up foolishness.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15664,Community,1,"It feels familiar and fresh, with myriad possibilities in front of it thanks to smart new cast additions and a renewed focus on those characters over just getting lost in the creatively inane.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15665,Community,0,"Diehard fans will probably still find much to enjoy, but I'm inclined to think it's time for everybody to graduate from Greendale Community College, and get on with their lives.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15666,Community,1,"It might not be exactly the same, but it's still better than most shows in its genre are.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15667,Community,1,Community is a niche taste; it makes sense that it has found a home on the internet where those that love it can enjoy it and those that don't can forget about it.,Hulu,88%,88%,37

15670,Community,1,"The cast is missing a couple of familiar faces, but judging from the first new episode, ""Ladders,"" the meta-jokes and movie-trope uses are back in full force.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15671,Community,1,"Shows get older. It happens. That said, I laughed, I was happy to see Abed and Britta and everyone else, and I'm hopeful that the newbies will become as quickly assimilated into the group as Buzz and Duncan were last season.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15672,Community,1,This is a show constantly in the process of becoming something else.,Hulu,88%,88%,37
15673,Community,1,"Whatever doubts you've had about the changes, Community has already pre-doubted them. But the first thing that matters is if the latest reboot still has the comedy goods, and it does.",Hulu,88%,88%,37
15674,Community,0,it's hard to shake the feeling that Community's continued existence has taken precedence over purpose. It's an overall diminishment that isn't helped by the shrinking cast.,Hulu,88%,88%,37
15675,Community,1,"Be assured that, as Frankie says of Greendale, this new funky version of Community is ""weird, passionate, and gross."" But, you know, gleefully gross.",Hulu,88%,88%,37

15678,Modern Family,0,"Overall, though, it felt a bit dutiful. As though the cast, much like the characters, knew that it had become a bit too claustrophobic, but still weren't wholly sure they had the guts to go.",Hulu,85%,89%,14
15679,Modern Family,1,"As the last few minutes of the finale ticked away, I remained surprisingly uplifted, even amidst their tear-jerking hugs.",Hulu,85%,89%,14
15680,Modern Family,1,"The poignant drama is lightened by a sprinkling of silly comedic detours, which are funny enough but also a reminder this show has reached its natural conclusion.",Hulu,85%,89%,14
15681,Modern Family,1,"Modern Family never stopped being funny, and the finale was comfortingly consistent with the series as a whole: A snappy, smart, and unabashedly sentimental celebration of the folks we love (and sometimes hate) the most.",Hulu,85%,89%,14

15683,Modern Family,1,"The hour-long finale hits every familiar ""Modern Family"" note just right.",Hulu,85%,89%,14
15684,Modern Family,1,"The writers had some work to do in terms of pulling it all together, offering a finale that was worthy of the show's mix of big, broad laughs and tender, family-oriented heart. For the most part, the show delivered just that.",Hulu,85%,89%,14
15685,Modern Family,0,"The show should've ended years ago, when it was better equipped to tie together all these subplots, characters, and themes. Now, we're left with an ending that doesn't really want to be an ending.",Hulu,85%,89%,14
15686,Modern Family,1,"In a world gone soft while praising so much mediocrity, I found it interesting when viewers went out of their way to complain that ""Modern Family"" had lost its magic. It never really did.",Hulu,85%,89%,14

15702,Line of Duty,1,"I've griped about various bits of this show over the years - the jargon, the references to people and places we'd completely forgotten about... but it stands head and shoulders above most other dramas.",Hulu,96%,94%,22
15703,Line of Duty,1,"But in the last few episodes of Line of Duty and particularly the finale, containing a supposedly towering speech by Hastings so pedestrian that even Dunbar could barely sell it, the message has hardly been moulded at all. I",Hulu,96%,94%,22

15705,Line of Duty,1,The casting of Macdonald is another masterstroke in a series that has never been short of them -- her performance is nothing short of sublime.,Hulu,96%,94%,22

15707,Line of Duty,0,It all feels very much as if Line Of Duty is running out of energy and impetus. Six seasons is one too many.,Hulu,96%,94%,22
15708,Line of Duty,1,"I have hopes for Macdonald as the most intriguing villain yet. The acting, the facial hints of a double, if not triple, life, subtle, that ageless face able to morph from tender to slab-cold cruel within an eyebrow.",Hulu,96%,94%,22

15711,Line of Duty,1,"Line of Duty has been a smash for lots of reasons. The tight as a tourniquet plotting. The sensational twists. The slick editing. But at its heart are the three main characters, the little family against the machine.",Hulu,96%,94%,22
15712,Line of Duty,0,"As we embark on series six, a far greater problem is the weight of the past. As the plot races on, names and events float to the surface of my consciousness like something disturbing in a canal.",Hulu,96%,94%,22

15716,Mr Inbetween,1,"Ryan's writing is crisp and taut - there's no sense that like many writers working in the crime genre he is learning what the story is as he is telling it, that breadcrumbs are leading him along. He is as abrupt and obdurate as his leading man.",Hulu,95%,98%,2
15717,Mr Inbetween,1,"Ryan's marvelous performance provides the glue that holds everything together. His character is a callous killer for hire, but, without smoothing out any of the rough edges, the actor makes you care about him",Hulu,95%,98%,2

15723,Preacher,1,"Had the showrunners elected to call this series by a different name it may have been a modest hit or a cult classic. Instead, AMC's Preacher is a series that just shares a title with an iconic comic book. This is not the Preacher we deserved.",Hulu,87%,75%,11

15727,Preacher,1,"Preacher exists at the fringes of Golden Age television: erudite, boundary-pushing but also bloody, profane, and decidedly niche.",Hulu,87%,75%,11
15728,Preacher,0,"This has always been the thing with Preacher, from the source material on. It has plenty to say about humanity & faith & life, but to hear it you have to live through the juvenilia. With Season 4, though, for the first time, that does not feel worth it.",Hulu,87%,75%,11
15729,Preacher,1,"One of the things that makes Preacher so much fun is its over-the-top lunacy, and the season premiere did not disappoint.",Hulu,87%,75%,11

16015,The Act,0,"Like many miniseries, the show suffers from pacing issues, hitting the same beats repeatedly to the point of frustration.",Hulu,88%,91%,49
16016,The Act,1,"The way the story is presented makes it easy to view it as a drama, and see how the events unfold, and with the amazing performances of Joey King and Patricia Arquette, it's set up to be a very addictive series so far.",Hulu,88%,91%,49
16017,The Act,0,"But what do we really learn about human nature, apart from: some people are weird? I enjoyed it for the performances: Chloë Sevigny, as Dee Dee's plain-talking neighbour Mel, and Joey King, who is brilliant as Dee Dee's helium-voiced daughter.",Hulu,88%,91%,49

16037,The Act,1,Arquette's performance is one for the mother-as-monster chronicles.,Hulu,88%,91%,49
16038,The Act,1,"The Act remains oddly fascinating, perhaps especially so as the strange, sad relationship between the needy Gypsy and disturbed Nick (Calum Worthy) develops.",Hulu,88%,91%,49
16039,The Act,1,"The scripts by Dean and Antosca and the performances by the two leads do a fine job exploring the murky power dynamic between mother and child... Both actors are terrific, but King is more likely the one people will be talking about after.",Hulu,88%,91%,49

16041,The Act,1,"I don't know quite how to feel about The Act, about the discomfort of seeing childhood abuse dressed up on screen, even if I know it's not for gawking, even if I recognize the pull the Blanchard story has on me anyway. Perhaps that is the point.",Hulu,88%,91%,49

16054,The Act,1,"""The Act"" is a compelling narrative to add to a post-#MeToo world. Men abuse power and sexuality of women, and in this case, a woman is abusing her power and sexuality of another woman (specifically her daughter).",Hulu,88%,91%,49

16067,Homeland,1,"It's hard to say that later Homeland is ""better"" than those chaotic early years, but mentor-mentee friction between Carrie and Saul was worth sticking around for. And [the finale] was, above all else, a satisfying pay-off to that relationship.",Hulu,85%,86%,27

16078,Homeland,1,Freeing itself of its original narrative moorings has done it nothing but good. It's also a testament to the thoughtfulness and intelligence of showrunners Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa that it has stayed so on the ball.,Hulu,85%,86%,27
16079,Homeland,1,"My favorite part of the new season, honestly, might have been reflecting on how, after this lengthy Homeland journey, the character who has gravitated up the call sheet by virtue of sheer survival has been Maury Sterling's Max.",Hulu,85%,86%,27
16080,Homeland,0,"The finish wasn't entirely convincing, and while it provided a degree of closure, didn't loop back to the show's origins as deftly as one might have hoped.",Hulu,85%,86%,27
16081,Homeland,1,"The first three episodes are a bit clunky, with Carrie's familiar pattern of alienating nearly everyone she meets kicking in again - and then Episode 4 comes along and ""Homeland"" finds its groove.",Hulu,85%,86%,27
16082,Homeland,1,"The first four episodes of the season have their wild plot lurches but also the gimlet eye for human nature of ""Homeland"" at its best.",Hulu,85%,86%,27
16083,Homeland,0,"Overall the first four episodes made available for review plod along... But then, just as I'm about to write off this final season, something happens at the end of the fourth episode that pulls me right back in. Just like Carrie, I can't seem to let go.",Hulu,85%,86%,27
16084,Homeland,1,"Lesli Linka Glatter returns for the first two episodes... and, for as much credit as she rightly gets for her beautifully staged and tensely cut action sequences, the performances she evokes in a still or slightly shifting frame are incredible.",Hulu,85%,86%,27

16086,Castle Rock,1,"While the second season doesn't end on quite the slam-bang note that the first did, it does a very solid job of tying this season into Misery proper, leaving the door wide open for what might happen in the show's next iteration.",Hulu,88%,79%,36
16087,Castle Rock,1,"Despite some potential lost, we still got a character-driven, compelling season, with the sensation of something old, dreadful and especially eerie seeping out of the history of Castle Rock into its new inhabitants.",Hulu,88%,79%,36
16088,Castle Rock,1,"Season 2 evokes the best Stephen King adaptations by ramping up the pacing, dread, and slasher flick fun in a way the first season didn't.",Hulu,88%,79%,36
16089,Castle Rock,0,"There are so many threads being woven together, and try as they might, there's just not enough knots being tied to make it all work. In the end, everyone suffers, and we're left with cheeky references, hollow drama, and zero stakes.",Hulu,88%,79%,36
16090,Castle Rock,1,"Castle Rock delivers the expected violence, suspense, and horror. But its most abundant strength is its faithful adherence to one of King's primary tenets as an author: that there is nothing more frightening then the unpredictability of human nature.",Hulu,88%,79%,36
16091,Castle Rock,1,One of this season's greatest strengths is how it excels at depicting Annie's psychosis and paranoia in visually different and creative ways. It continually feels fresh and stressful.,Hulu,88%,79%,36
16092,Castle Rock,1,"A lot of horror anthologies hinge on concept instead of character or performance, but I'm happy to see ""Castle Rock"" bucking that trend.",Hulu,88%,79%,36

16094,Castle Rock,1,"It's a dark ending, to be sure, but the right one.",Hulu,88%,79%,36
16095,Castle Rock,1,Castle Rock's second season gets a welcome fresh coat of creative paint with the addition of Lizzy Caplan's engaging performance as Misery's Annie Wilkes.,Hulu,88%,79%,36

16101,Castle Rock,1,"It remains to be seen whether the end result will be a success, or end with the sort of vaguely disappointing whimper last season landed on, but for now I'm absolutely thrilled by the guts the show has found.",Hulu,88%,79%,36
16102,Castle Rock,1,The show is finally more than a flailing attempt to monetize Stephen King-related intellectual property.,Hulu,88%,79%,36
16103,Castle Rock,1,"Castle Rock remains an atmospheric, grippingly acted series that captures the feeling of King's fiction while exploring corners of his world that even he might not have imagined existing.",Hulu,88%,79%,36
16104,Castle Rock,1,"[Lizzie] Caplan, is unsettlingly good as Annie, giving a performance that can be emotionally poignant in one scene and petrifying in another, turning on a dime in an instant.",Hulu,88%,79%,36
16105,Castle Rock,1,"What's here is still effective, affecting, and original - despite appearances.",Hulu,88%,79%,36
16106,Castle Rock,1,S2 has a morbid magnetism that pulls you in and makes you hit play all over again at the end of every episode.,Hulu,88%,79%,36
16107,Castle Rock,1,King fans will get a continued kick out of their favorite King tropes being thrown together.,Hulu,88%,79%,36
16108,Castle Rock,0,"In this misguided series, the clash between grounded psychological horror and bump-in-the-night monster mania delivers fewer shivers than shrugs of confusion.",Hulu,88%,79%,36
16109,Castle Rock,1,"In its first half...Castle Rock keeps the supernatural elements lurking on the periphery, focusing instead on characters and family melodrama, anchored by Lizzy Caplan's commanding performance at the center.",Hulu,88%,79%,36
16110,Castle Rock,0,There's little apparent benefit to how the show's second season foregrounds its interpersonal relationships.,Hulu,88%,79%,36
16111,Castle Rock,1,"The moody atmosphere from the first season is back, and the show never really lets up from that.",Hulu,88%,79%,36
16112,Castle Rock,0,"I can't tell if the new season is over-reaching, under-reaching or if the Annie Wilkes of it all is just overshadowing the story to an unanticipated degree.",Hulu,88%,79%,36
16113,Castle Rock,1,"There's still plenty of King paraphernalia floating around for eagle-eyed viewers to latch onto, but Castle Rock is no longer so insistent of its importance to the overall story. Instead, the series mercifully lets the narrative speak for itself.",Hulu,88%,79%,36
16114,Castle Rock,1,"Castle Rock Season 2 does a wonderful job of borrowing reoccurring themes from King's massive body of work and splicing them together to make something that appears, at least on its surface, wholly original.",Hulu,88%,79%,36
16115,Castle Rock,1,"I wish I could tell you about all of the twists and turns this season takes, but that would ruin what is shaping up to be one of the best seasons of television this year.",Hulu,88%,79%,36
16116,Castle Rock,1,"Despite all its high drama, season two feels a little more conventional in its narrative, and that'll likely make for a more satisfying story arc, especially with all the horror-fantasy elements to come.",Hulu,88%,79%,36
16117,Castle Rock,1,"[Caplan's] performance is masterfully physical, from her carefully impassive smile to the way she holds her arms stiffly at her sides as she walks; the actress embodies a woman who is struggling to control a constant surge of inner turmoil.",Hulu,88%,79%,36
16118,Castle Rock,1,"Anchored by Lizzy Caplan's compelling performance, this season has cracked the Stephen King code for a thrilling and engaging mystery.",Hulu,88%,79%,36
16119,Castle Rock,1,"Misery and 'Salem's Lot, two vastly different King novels, make for strange bedfellows.",Hulu,88%,79%,36

16122,11.22.63,1,"While ""11.22.53"" never really reaches the level of craftsmanship of ""House of Cards"" or ""The Man In the High Castle,"" it makes up for it in it's immense ""can't stop watching"" entertainment value.",Hulu,83%,88%,64

16124,11.22.63,1,"Despite its occasional clumsiness, 11.22.63 is an entertaining effort.",Hulu,83%,88%,64
16125,11.22.63,1,"There is still so much story to tell in 11.22.63, so many triumphs and mischances awaiting, but ""The Rabbit Hole"" started on such strong footing that the rest of the journey feels like it's in the bag.",Hulu,83%,88%,64
16126,11.22.63,1,"Overall, however, the series makes for decent passive television, something that can be consumed while simultaneously preoccupied with another passive activity.",Hulu,83%,88%,64

16132,11.22.63,0,"11.22.63 is just here to entertain. And that's fine! But if the series wanted us to look past some truly awful things Jake does in the name of changing the past, it should've clarified what it wanted us to think of its protagonist.",Hulu,83%,88%,64

16422,The X-Files,1,"Duchovny and Anderson still share mad chemistry and, as a bereft mother, Anderson can be downright haunting.",Hulu,74%,85%,40
16423,The X-Files,1,"Indeed, as time goes by, it's somewhat more fun to just appreciate the actors: Mulder and Scully remain fixed in their philosophical positions and reactions to various wild events, but Anderson and Duchovny have become more subtle performers.",Hulu,74%,85%,40
16424,The X-Files,1,"When The X-Files isn't diving into bottomless rabbit holes of overlapping and pretentiously mystifying conspiracy theories, it can still be great, spooky fun nearly a quarter-century since its debut.",Hulu,74%,85%,40
16425,The X-Files,0,"I honestly can't tell whether or not Mulder's dialogue is supposed to sound ridiculous (in the second episode he utters this baffling phrase: ""Scully, you looked so adorbs"").",Hulu,74%,85%,40
16426,The X-Files,0,"The adjustments made for the opening episode show less of the kind of creative skills that made episodes like ""Triangle,"" ""Home"" and ""Ice"" so memorable and come across as a uninspired solution to what looked like an unfixable situation.",Hulu,74%,85%,40
16427,The X-Files,1,"The stand-alone ""monster of the week"" episodes are more enjoyable, and truer to the show's most successful element, and the weird playful ones, at least the one included in the critics' sampler, shine most brightly of all.",Hulu,74%,85%,40
16428,The X-Files,0,"A lot of the return to night is devoted to chase scenes and makes one appreciate by comparison how much better a reboot ""Twin Peaks"" was last year.",Hulu,74%,85%,40
16429,The X-Files,1,"Now more than ever, The X-Files functions best when it keeps its focus narrow and wipes the slate from week to week. That's the way we're all coping: Trying not to think about our last episode. Or, scarier still, our next.",Hulu,74%,85%,40
16430,The X-Files,1,True believers who have devoured most if not all of the 208 previous episodes likely will find it thrilling simply to be strung along anew.,Hulu,74%,85%,40
16431,The X-Files,1,The X-Files is shockingly relevant again and tackling current affairs better than it did in its original run and has a lot of fun doing it.,Hulu,74%,85%,40
16432,The X-Files,1,"Just like the best seasons of this show, Season 11 will keep you off-balance about what kind of episode you're going to get, but Anderson and Duchovny-still game for freaky fun after all these years-are there to guide you through the dark.",Hulu,74%,85%,40
16433,The X-Files,1,"The X-Files still produces excellent stand-alone TV episodes -- tremendously entertaining hours with the show's familiar blend of spookiness, self-deprecating humor and cleverly conceptual in-jokes that only the initiated can really appreciate.",Hulu,74%,85%,40

16437,The X-Files,1,"The 2016 six-episode revival was solid, but Season 11 really hits its stride, flexing the full range of X-Files muscles (horror, sci-fi, mystery, comedy, romance) and fully embracing its aging heroes and place in the age of fake news.",Hulu,74%,85%,40

16444,You're the Worst,1,"It's a fitting send-off for a show that is ending at the right time; truly, there's only so much more deplorable behavior from these Californians that we could happily continue to tolerate.",Hulu,95%,88%,13

16449,You're the Worst,1,"[Jimmy and Gemma] will definitely be put through the ringer this season as they plan their wedding, but Falk gives them the reprieve they deserve in the premiere... It's the beginning of the end of their love story.",Hulu,95%,88%,13
16450,You're the Worst,1,"What I will tell you is that this show, which for years took every possible stab it could at the callow selfishness of its characters, ends up embracing them with empathy and understanding.",Hulu,95%,88%,13
16451,You're the Worst,1,"Throughout, Season 5 celebrates every aspect of what's made the series a standout -- especially its cast.",Hulu,95%,88%,13
16452,You're the Worst,1,"It's scathingly funny, but also acutely sad. Though the show is mostly rooting for Jimmy and Gretchen to get over themselves and make it work, it also doesn't run from the idea that neither can be their best so long as they're with the other.",Hulu,95%,88%,13

16460,Friday Night Lights,1,"Friday Night Lights, at its best, was utterly unique viewing, gut-rattling and occasionally almost suffocating. Like family, it could leave you smiling or sobbing. Or, on occasion, both.",Hulu,97%,93%,27

16462,Friday Night Lights,1,"The people of Dillon show us the best in ourselves, and if that's the definition of predictable, then TV is sorely lacking in predictable fare, and the end of Friday Night Lights will be felt for years to come.",Hulu,97%,93%,27
16463,Friday Night Lights,1,"The difference between Friday Night Lights and so many other humdrum, forgettable ""soft"" dramas is the strength of the writing, the believability of the actors and characters they play, and ultimately, how effectively it's all put together.",Hulu,97%,93%,27

16467,Friday Night Lights,1,What's most remarkable about Friday Night Lights (outside of the quality of the writing and acting on the actual program) is how the show survived.,Hulu,97%,93%,27
16468,Friday Night Lights,1,Even an episode that has all of the excitement of new beginnings still managed to tug at my heartstrings.,Hulu,97%,93%,27
16469,Friday Night Lights,1,I'm generally impressed with how well the final season wrapped up.,Hulu,97%,93%,27

16474,Friday Night Lights,1,"As always, it's good to be back in Dillon.",Hulu,97%,93%,27
16475,Friday Night Lights,1,"The series has several faults, but its strange concoction of emotions makes for some seriously compelling television.",Hulu,97%,93%,27
16476,Friday Night Lights,1,"While this season's arc may be presented too broadly, with a cast this strong it's difficult not to become ensnared in the raw emotions of Dillon, Texas.",Hulu,97%,93%,27
16477,Friday Night Lights,1,"For a show whose ratings never justified a second season, five seasons is an achievement to celebrate.",Hulu,97%,93%,27
16478,Friday Night Lights,1,"The show, and its survival, offers proof that quality can triumph in an industry driven by quantity and that even though necessity is the more fertile of the two, poetry can also be a fine mother to invention.",Hulu,97%,93%,27
16479,Friday Night Lights,1,"This is a show that's scored way more than it has faltered, and the opening episode suggests that streak will continue.",Hulu,97%,93%,27
16480,Friday Night Lights,1,"This show went to places that most shows aren't brave enough to go. For that reason, it'll forever be in the 'win' column.",Hulu,97%,93%,27
16481,Friday Night Lights,1,"This is a place, and a show, I will never want to leave. It feels like family. But we're lucky to have been given this much of their story. Underdogs to the end, these are my TV heroes.",Hulu,97%,93%,27
16482,24,1,"As long as all you ask of it is more familiar twists and backstabbing, you'll probably be happy with it.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16483,24,1,"The shorter season meant a tighter and better-told story, and less time to get lost in the woods (perhaps literally) with lame characters or D-plots that had no real impact on the people who everyone in the audience cared about.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16484,24,1,"In fact, it's difficult to think of anything the comeback did wrong, other than making me wish they were going to make another season.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16485,24,0,Is this a series too far?,Hulu,87%,86%,55
16486,24,0,Live Another Day feels terribly dated.,Hulu,87%,86%,55

16488,24,1,"It's hard not to want more. Four years of being clean, then a double hit - hmmm, that's good - and yeah, I'm back too.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16489,24,1,A consolation then that 24 doesn't have any of draggy stuff that so quickly palled Homeland's charms; there are no stroppy teenagers in Jack's world.,Hulu,87%,86%,55
16490,24,1,"Even with its five-minute commercial breaks, 24: Live Another Day is much better than anyone could have expected, and promises to bring some zing to TV's spring.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16491,24,1,"Jack indeed returned in the show's debut episode Monday night, reminding me of all the reasons I used to devote an hour a week to the action-packed show.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16492,24,1,The details are no more believable or credible than they ever were. But since when did any of that matter? The result is still pretty entertaining.,Hulu,87%,86%,55
16493,24,1,"Let's hope that the shorter season will allow the writers to keep it simpler and stronger. After seeing the first two episodes, we gotta trust them.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16494,24,1,"It's always good to see an old friend, and an old pro in action. Live Another Day gives us both.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16495,24,1,Half the hours. Twice the mayhem.,Hulu,87%,86%,55
16496,24,0,"The contemporary anxiety 24 hopes to exploit this time around is of drones and of the increasingly dehumanized nature of warfare, but it has become a sort of dehumanized show, populated by barely human characters.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16497,24,1,It is sort of brilliant that 24: Live Another Day takes place in the UK.,Hulu,87%,86%,55
16498,24,1,"Detractors will say Day 9 repeats the same old formula from eight seasons of 24 as if that's a bad thing. Sure, it's familiar-but like a roller coaster you refuse to quit, it's a wildly entertaining, addictive thrill ride.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16499,24,1,"After a four-year absence, 24 is back, and its return couldn't be more welcome.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16500,24,1,"I can't imagine how [it] looks to a novice viewer, but as a longtime fan who came to embrace the show's ridiculous core, it's slightly thrilling to slip back into the old rhythms, to feel my pulse quicken in time with that accelerating countdown.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16501,24,1,"24: Live Another Day seeks to prove that less is more, slowly revving up the comfortably formulaic engine while visceral split-screen editing once again intensifies the literally explosive twists.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16502,24,1,"Damn it, Jack and Chloe! It's good to see both of you back on my television screen again.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16503,24,1,"In this universe, that so resembles yours, there's no option for being cast out, for remaining out, that choices cannot be made, but are only made for [Chloe] and Jack Bauer and you, too.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16504,24,0,This abbreviated 12-episode revival may be an improvement because of the way it galvanizes the pace. Turns out Jack didn't need a whole day to save our bacon.,Hulu,87%,86%,55
16505,24,1,Maybe absence really does make the heart grow fonder. I couldn't even begin to miss Jack until he went away.,Hulu,87%,86%,55
16506,24,1,Live Another Day's drone story extends Bush-era mechanized warfare into the age of Obama. It's another example of 24's knack for mixing left- and right-wing assumptions into a ferocious action film cocktail.,Hulu,87%,86%,55
16507,24,1,"As an optimist and a fan of the original series, the suspenseful and action-packed first two hours of 24: Live Another Day give me hope that we're not only seeing Jack Bauer's big comeback, but 24's as well. The clock is ticking and we're ready.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16508,24,1,"This is one of those rare cases when the same old, same old isn't such a bad thing, especially if you love 24. All the elements are there - conspiracy within conspiracy, intense action, and, of course, the whole real time thing.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16509,24,1,"Ultimately, the particulars of 24's new normal don't really matter. All that matters is Jack is back. For the first two hours, it feels like he never left.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16510,24,1,"Cool as it is to see Jack back in shoot-'em-up mode, the figure who caught my attention in the first two episodes was a new face: Yvonne Strahovski as disgraced CIA agent Kate Morgan.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16511,24,1,It's good kinetic fun that makes up for the show's narrative shorthand.,Hulu,87%,86%,55
16512,24,1,"Having long since proven that they can indeed fill 24 episodes with action, cutting it in half gives the creators the chance to cut the fat and deliver a lean, mean ride.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16513,24,1,"I'm ready to watch one more adventure story about the man who can save us from evil, even if the man, and the premise, feel like refugees from a bloody fairy tale.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16514,24,1,"The action-packed but still mostly brainless thriller is back, and as long as the series has no pretension to greatness, it's a lot of fun.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16515,24,1,"There are reasons we still love 24, despite the gaps in logic, the repetitious dialogue, the monotonously unrelenting tension and some wooden acting. It's the combination of action and character.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16516,24,1,"The best news is, you don't have to be a 24 diehard -- or have encyclopedic knowledge of all things Jack Bauer -- to enjoy 24: Live Another Day.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16517,24,1,"It was worth the wait, and the wait was good all around.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16518,24,1,24 is as much a thrill ride as ever.,Hulu,87%,86%,55
16519,24,0,"The Jack-as-wounded-hero archetype had been wrung dry long ago, and Live Another Day does nothing to find new life for it.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16520,24,1,"The first two episodes are a welcome invitation to the same old song and dance, but everyone involved will need to freshen up the choreography.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16521,24,1,The cat-and-mouse thriller that helped launch television's binge-watching craze when it debuted in 2001 remains as endearingly implausible as ever.,Hulu,87%,86%,55
16522,24,1,"As always, one of the chief pleasures of watching 24 is seeing Kiefer Sutherland essay the role of Jack. His portrayal of the man makes him deadly serious but stays on the right side of camp at all times.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16523,24,0,"This time it is far less potent. At 47, Sutherland wears Jack's evident fatigue (and extra wrinkles) like a badge, even though the script never gives him much to work with in the way of emotion or depth.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16524,24,1,"Jack will have his work cut out for him, and audiences will be as enthralled by 24 as they have ever been, if not more, and they'll have good reason.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16525,24,1,"A good opening salvo for what will probably be Jack's last day, at least on TV. Enjoy it while you can -- and it is enjoyable.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16526,24,1,"It's the middle-to-late hours where 24 so often succumbs to lame twists and wild leaps of implausibility. That's why a 12-episode edition of 24, at this stage, seems enticing.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16527,24,0,"While the format has been altered a bit... this new season is 12 episodes instead of 24 so some hours will be skipped -- everything else about the show is same-old, same-old.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16528,24,1,The producers have so embraced the larger-than-life elements of their beloved character that it's hard not to enjoy the show on those terms. We needed a hero in 2001. Maybe we need a superhero in 2014.,Hulu,87%,86%,55
16529,24,1,All the familiar elements are in place.,Hulu,87%,86%,55
16530,24,0,"Despite the high-grade action, the premiere is more a showcase for everything that was bad about 24 than a reminder of everything that was good.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16531,24,0,This 24 revival seems motivated by more pragmatic and mercenary considerations: trying to wring a few more nuggets out of a played-out goldmine.,Hulu,87%,86%,55
16532,24,0,"24 is still fast-paced for the most part, although a little slow off the mark in its first hour. And the 47-year-old Sutherland remains trim and limber as an aging Jack of few words, most of them downers.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16533,24,1,"In Live Another Day, time is allowed to pass between some episodes, resulting in a tighter, more action-packed storyline.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16534,24,1,"The reason to watch 24: Live Another Day isn't for ideology. It's to get caught up in a fast-paced, high-powered adventure played out by people we care about.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16535,24,1,"For fans who stuck around for all eight original seasons, Live Another Day offers more of what they loved. For everyone else, there's no reason to start now.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16536,24,1,"The clock is once again ticking, but it's unclear who or what is at stake - and that's a very good thing.",Hulu,87%,86%,55
16537,The Son,1,"It's a thoroughly decent exploration of the contest between ethics and burgeoning power, as well as a war of wills between a messed-up, morally ""flexible"" patriarch and his progeny.",Hulu,52%,87%,2
16538,The Son,1,"This is character driven action driving character, and truly artistic storytelling. It stays small, plays large.",Hulu,52%,87%,2
16539,Shadowhunters,1,The Final Hunt is going to be a ride.,Hulu,76%,80%,6
16540,Shadowhunters,1,"It's going to be a bumpy road ahead for everyone, I can feel it.",Hulu,76%,80%,6
16541,Shadowhunters,1,"All in all, not the most exciting season premiere in the history of television. But that's okay because there's plenty of material to work with and room for the stories to grow.",Hulu,76%,80%,6
16542,Shadowhunters,1,"As for the loves of my life, aka Magnus and Alec, I'm so happy that we're getting to see their relationship develop more.",Hulu,76%,80%,6
16543,Shadowhunters,1,"Shadowhunters may have given us a pretty dark episode, what with Jace turning out to be the person under the Owl's mysterious mask all along - more on that later - but at least it was tempered with some adorable domestic Malec moments.",Hulu,76%,80%,6
16544,Shadowhunters,1,Lilith's disciples could be the toughest enemies the group has had to fight yet.,Hulu,76%,80%,6
16545,The Strain,1,The fallout has happened and Dr. Goodweather has lost. This is a good starting point after three seasons of the same thing.,Hulu,79%,76%,12
16546,The Strain,1,"The Strain proved rewarding in its finality, allowing characters who had endured the threat, lost loved ones and bravely faced a supernatural foe a hard-earned ray of hope.",Hulu,79%,76%,12
16547,The Strain,1,"This is what it's like to see The Strain firing on all cylinders, finally.",Hulu,79%,76%,12
16548,The Strain,1,"Unequivocally, the fourth and final season of The Strain has been the show's best.",Hulu,79%,76%,12
16549,The Strain,1,"Most of the worst aspects of this episode were things that have annoyed me throughout the series. And yet, there were plenty of facets of the series finale that worked really well",Hulu,79%,76%,12
16550,The Strain,1,"But the series found its way back to top form in its final season, its bleakest yet, as the characters reckoned with their own fates after a disaster left them ostracized from each other and utterly hopeless.",Hulu,79%,76%,12
16551,The Strain,1,"It's obvious that all of the core cast members are spread out all over the place, but are still in touch to some degree, with each working towards a specific goal.",Hulu,79%,76%,12
16552,The Strain,1,"Indeed, it feels like the show is preparing to tie everything together into a satisfying end that rewards all who stuck it out for the four year run.",Hulu,79%,76%,12
16553,The Strain,1,"The Strain, created by Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan and run by the longtime producer Carlton Cuse, is a prime example of traditional, meticulous craftsmanship and slow-building suspense.",Hulu,79%,76%,12
16554,The Strain,1,"With the end finally on the horizon, there's a sense that because it's all coming to an end anyway, The Strain can finally throw caution to the wind and really let its freak flag fly.",Hulu,79%,76%,12
16555,The Strain,1,"While fairly slow starting out, The Strain's fourth season eventually built to a satisfying conclusion as it rearranged the playing field and explored the far-reaching effects of the Master's rise to power.",Hulu,79%,76%,12

16559,A Teacher,1,A Teacher is generally engaging and more rewarding if you stick with it to the end.,Hulu,73%,56%,33
16560,A Teacher,0,I can't help thinking A Teacher might have imparted its lesson better if it weren't quite so enraptured of the affair too.,Hulu,73%,56%,33
16561,A Teacher,1,"Maybe A Teacher will stir awareness of the insidious patterns of abuse, but its storytelling doesn't rise to the complexity of its subject matter.",Hulu,73%,56%,33
16562,A Teacher,1,"A Teacher's subject matter won't be for everyone - it rightly comes with a grooming warning - but if you're a fan of sensitively handled, superbly paced, suspense-filled drama, then you'll likely be quickly hooked.",Hulu,73%,56%,33
16563,A Teacher,0,t's a shame because those scenes show that the series is capable of good visual storytelling. So it just makes the whole experience worse when you realize the missed potential.,Hulu,73%,56%,33
16564,A Teacher,1,"The slow drip of short weekly episodes does not do the series any favors, because the sum of the series is much stronger than the episodes standing alone.",Hulu,73%,56%,33

16567,A Teacher,1,"This series understands how quickly bad decisions can develop into something toxic, and how even the most alluring predators can manipulate a sense of trust from their victims.",Hulu,73%,56%,33
16568,A Teacher,1,Mara plays this up with an extraordinary multilayered performance designed to throw us off balance and at various times she leaves the viewer unsure of what to think.,Hulu,73%,56%,33
16569,A Teacher,1,"A Teacher doesn't try to spare its audience when it comes to how its core relationship develops; its banal portrait of a predator and the affair she creates does a good job accomplishing it's goal, which is to make its audience squirm.",Hulu,73%,56%,33
16570,A Teacher,1,"Graphic sexually - this is FX on Hulu, after all - but also in its unsparing emotional honesty, A Teacher aims to bring unusual depth to this unpleasant subject and largely succeeds. Still, this is one life lesson that shouldn't have been taught.",Hulu,73%,56%,33

16579,A Teacher,1,"It's purposefully disquieting and thoroughly disturbing, anchored by strong performances from Mara and Robinson that underscore how our gendered stereotypes are failing those who need protection most.",Hulu,73%,56%,33

16618,Looking for Alaska,1,"In 2019, Hulu's adaptation of the book somehow feels truer to the story Green set out to tell than the book itself.",Hulu,91%,92%,35
16619,Looking for Alaska,1,The result is a series that is probably infinitely better than the movie ever would have been but which also feels distinctly of an era - a throwback to a time nobody is ready to be nostalgic for just yet.,Hulu,91%,92%,35
16620,Looking for Alaska,1,Even with its flaws - including a narrative slowdown around Ep. 4 - this is a rare teen-lit adaptation that works on multiple levels. And that's something worth looking for.,Hulu,91%,92%,35
16621,Looking for Alaska,1,"The show hit home - and not just for its throwback music and early-2000s fashion. It's poised to do the same for today's teens, for reasons that go far beyond appearances.",Hulu,91%,92%,35

16623,Looking for Alaska,1,"All of the characters in this show are exceptional. None of them are good people; they are all deeply unlikable, but still likable at the same time, which makes them very real.",Hulu,91%,92%,35
16624,Looking for Alaska,1,"Through the first four episodes, Looking for Alaska has done a great job of creating perfectly flawed characters. There is not one character that is all good or all bad. Just like life.",Hulu,91%,92%,35
16625,Looking for Alaska,1,"Not only does the adaptation capture the nostalgic feeling of reading the novel for the first time (say at 15, awkward and lovelorn), it handles tragedy much more delicately and naturally than other teen series in recent years.",Hulu,91%,92%,35
16626,Looking for Alaska,0,"This is all pretty stiff, predictable stuff, built around the operatic pangs of teen romance.",Hulu,91%,92%,35

16631,Looking for Alaska,0,"""Looking For Alaska"" is nostalgic for itself, like it's admiring itself in a mirror instead of making eye contact. This neutralizes the immediacy and intimacy that can make coming-of-age stories so special.",Hulu,91%,92%,35

16633,Looking for Alaska,1,"It feels like it fits right along with the Schwartz/Savage oeuvre (The O.C., Gossip Girl), but because it's based on John Green's novel, it's a little different.",Hulu,91%,92%,35
16634,Looking for Alaska,1,It's a terrific cast with some choice music.,Hulu,91%,92%,35
16635,Looking for Alaska,1,"Looking for Alaska isn't trying to replace the book, nor would it ever. It breathes new life into the material, introducing it to a fresh audience while giving us old hats the chance to view our treasured story from a different perspective.",Hulu,91%,92%,35
16636,Looking for Alaska,1,"Hulu's Looking for Alaska is a coming of age story done right. Yes, it's filled with the melodrama you would expect from a teen drama, but it delivers a solid plot about a group of younger people trying to find themselves in the world.",Hulu,91%,92%,35

16644,Looking for Alaska,1,"It's a familiar coming-of-age story, but one executed at a high level, and with far more thought than usual given to all the kids who were forced to grow up long before the main character has to.",Hulu,91%,92%,35
16645,Looking for Alaska,1,"It's as if Looking for Alaska was cut loose from the anchor of Miles's narratorial voice and then swung in the direction of the strongest prevailing wind, drifting toward all the new, rich material the miniseries finds.",Hulu,91%,92%,35
16646,Looking for Alaska,1,"Hulu's Looking For Alaska limited series is sure to become a coming-of-age mainstay, a series teenagers and adults alike will turn to for comfort and catharsis as the seasons of their lives turn and loss inevitably comes, as it is wont to do.",Hulu,91%,92%,35

16650,Death Note,1,"The storyline is terrific -- as with horror-fantasies like Boogiepop Phantom and Paranoia Agent, Death Note doesn't limit the focus to the protagonist, and it considers the effects his activities would have on society at large.",Hulu,100%,96%,14
16651,Death Note,1,[Death Note] deserves a space on the list of the best anime of all time.,Hulu,100%,96%,14
16652,Death Note,1,Death Note's audacious attempt to explore and even question the idea of morality is ambitious and ultimately more hit than miss.,Hulu,100%,96%,14
16653,Death Note,1,My final take on Death Note is thus: This was the greatest anime there has ever been. This was the greatest anime dub there has ever been.,Hulu,100%,96%,14
16654,Death Note,1,Some droning voice acting leadens what is otherwise a brilliantly terse noir.,Hulu,100%,96%,14
16655,Death Note,1,This cat-and-mouse series is highly addictive.,Hulu,100%,96%,14
16656,Death Note,1,"Death Note holds a prominent position in the canon of modern anime, and at only 37 episodes is well worth the time it'll take you to watch it.",Hulu,100%,96%,14
16657,Death Note,1,Death Note is a fascinating concept that heads into unsuspected territory. It's unlikely that you'd find a sociopath...as the protagonist in a Western television show.,Hulu,100%,96%,14
16658,Death Note,1,"The slow, subtle character progression keeps you addicted to the chaos, as you watch the series' main character evolve alongside it.",Hulu,100%,96%,14
16659,Death Note,1,A somewhat brainy series that explores the mind of a young man whose almost childlike vision of a new world allows him to detach himself from the immorality of his acts.,Hulu,100%,96%,14
16660,Death Note,1,"Beyond its deft twists and turns, Death Note also addresses questions about morality, justice, and capital punishment. All this, plus beautiful animation and well-written dialogue and plot, makes Death Note the cream of the animated crop.",Hulu,100%,96%,14

16663,Cardinal,1,Talk about revenge being a dish best served cold.,Hulu,87%,83%,7
16664,Cardinal,1,"It's a good mystery, a mood piece beautifully performed and strikingly made, with great sensitivity to what the cold landscape harbours and reveals. It's quiet, hushed, letting the landscape articulate its wintry disposition.",Hulu,87%,83%,7
16665,Cardinal,0,The whole thing was so chilly that it left me craving a show that is the absolute opposite of this in every way: Death in Paradise.,Hulu,87%,83%,7
16666,Cardinal,1,"Cardinal provides that rare pleasure: a sense of something being better than it needs to be. It is slow without being frustrating or dull, thoughtful without being ponderous or pretentious.",Hulu,87%,83%,7
16667,Cardinal,1,"It is therefore wonderful, and hooks, if slowly, from the outset. This series looks set to echo, a little late admittedly, the birth of Scandi noir.",Hulu,87%,83%,7
16668,Cardinal,1,"Fortunately, Cardinal has reached the point when the personnel are more interesting than the perps, so we'll stick with it if only to find out if Lise and Cardinal ever do have that coffee. We'll stay for the snow-packed landscape too.",Hulu,87%,83%,7

16670,The Adventures of Merlin,1,Colin Morgan and Bradley James have always had incredible chemistry and it's all cashed in here. Their scenes are heartbreaking and beautifully portrayed. There was more bromance in this one episode that in Sherlock and Supernatural put together.,Hulu,85%,86%,10
16671,The Adventures of Merlin,1,"It's always been classy fare, but if anything Merlin is even more confident now. Still expansively filmed and able to entice great names, there's now more beef to the battles and punch to the humour.",Hulu,85%,86%,10

16678,The Adventures of Merlin,1,"Merlin had big shoes to fill -- it was the series that ran when Doctor Who... wasn't on our screen. With series five, it filled those shoes admirably. Each episode has been an achievement in storytelling",Hulu,85%,86%,10
16679,The Adventures of Merlin,1,The show's writers have ensured that Merlin: Arthur's Bane Part 1 has thrust us back into the heart of an intriguing world of myth and magic.,Hulu,85%,86%,10
16680,Dave,0,"Dave is still a biting satire set within the music industry that depicts the many pitfalls of making it to the main stage at Coachella. But especially this season, it's sometimes difficult to watch.",Hulu,84%,85%,11
16681,Dave,1,"If the first season of Dave was a revelation, a shocker of epic proportions both in the quality of the story and the lengths the show will venture to for a laugh, then the second season is a continued journey on that upward path.",Hulu,84%,85%,11
16682,Dave,1,"Painful and privileged, but clever.",Hulu,84%,85%,11
16683,Dave,1,"Overall, this season tries to walk a very thin line. The stunning part is it kind of works. In Season 2, Dave is at his worst. But Dave is at its best...",Hulu,84%,85%,11
16684,Dave,1,"With more focus and subtlety than before, the new season of Dave proves this is a series worth your time. And let's be honest, those stupid jokes still make us belly laugh.",Hulu,84%,85%,11
16685,Dave,1,"Instead of devoting episodes to supporting characters, it devotes its season to critiquing Dave's singular identity - namely, how his viewpoint is rooted in whiteness and privilege.",Hulu,84%,85%,11
16686,Dave,1,Don't let the childish marketing fool you. Or do let the childish marketing fool you. Just give Dave a try.,Hulu,84%,85%,11

16688,Dave,1,"Dave might be self-centered, but Dave at its best spreads its attention between all its characters. Fine, fine, I'll follow.",Hulu,84%,85%,11
16689,Dave,1,"This was already an excellent show that seems to have leveled up in its second season. As he works on the new album, Dave the character is struggling to expand what he can do; Dave the comedy has already figured that out.",Hulu,84%,85%,11
16690,Dave,1,"[Dave has] sharper humor that feels like it's taking risks with more confidence, even as Lil Dicky himself lacks exactly that.",Hulu,84%,85%,11
16691,The First,1,"Sadly mistaken for a full on sci fi epic, The First is a drama quest on our limits and emotions. Sean Penn shines. [Full review in Spanish].",Hulu,66%,77%,62

16907,Ramy,1,"It's all a very different kind of punchline that allows the storytelling to feel much more authentic-even when the plot feels completely unrealistic, it's still grounded in reality.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16908,Ramy,1,"I didn't expect season two to have the low-grade anxiety of Uncut Gems (for me), where you're always on your toes because you know that Ramy is going to mess up... I think that it's impressive that I love a show about an awful, horny man.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16909,Ramy,1,Not since Master of None has the displaced immigrant experience been told with such authenticity and such tongue-in-cheek humor.,Hulu,96%,86%,41

16913,Ramy,1,"Ultimately, what makes Ramy powerful is how it manages to stay non-judgmental of its protagonist, and also steer away from him when it becomes overwhelming. The show provides no answers to any question he asks, and it's best that way.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16914,Ramy,1,"Ramy eventually veers towards episodes that highlight side characters which allows the series to have multiple perspectives on the Muslim-American immigrant experience. It's in these tangents, that the show shines.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16915,Ramy,1,"If in its first season, Ramy ... was a breath of fresh air (merely by focusing on an American-born Muslim), then the second season is a display of the series' empathetic depth.",Hulu,96%,86%,41

16919,Ramy,1,"When the laughs do come, they're highly rewarding. The most engaging aspect of Ramy, though is that simple, dogged question: how to be yourself, how to be modern, and still be a person of faith.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16920,Ramy,1,"Through Ramy's increased devotion, viewers get a broader understanding of Islam's tenets of peace and self-awareness, in addition to Youssef's brand of humor, which still illuminates the difficulties of being Muslim in American culture.",Hulu,96%,86%,41

16922,Ramy,1,"Ramy presents us with an exceedingly flawed protagonist. The show doesn't want to make him an example, and we not only see the beautiful aspects of his experiences but also the ridiculous ones.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16923,Ramy,1,"Throughout the 30-minute format provides enough time to get the story told without lollygagging...""Ramy"" will jump from one scene to the next almost before you can get the laugh out. Yet it rarely seems hurried.",Hulu,96%,86%,41

16925,Ramy,1,"Well-drawn supporting characters with sharp tongues help lighten the mood, and Hiam Abbass is hilarious as Ramy's daggy mother.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16926,Ramy,1,"Perhaps the most potent insight in this second season is the lead's amenable but pathological defiance of personal responsibility, his well-meaning and winsome brew of good intentions and self-obsession.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16927,Ramy,1,"Both depsite and because of uncomfortable moments like that, it's a joy to watch Ramy find his place in the world.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16928,Ramy,1,"It's a smarter, better show for being so hard on Ramy, in part because it knows him well enough to not let the whole story rest on one young millennial's shoulders.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16929,Ramy,1,"Ramy is still very funny and is as smart and easy to love as it ever was, and everything that made the first season award-worthy is present and stronger in its second go-round.",Hulu,96%,86%,41

16934,Ramy,1,"It's difficult to make a show about a protagonist who's as lazily acquiescent as Ramy, especially when supporting characters are seldom given the vivivdness to shine on their own. And yet it's impossible not to be moved by season two's guiding observation",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16935,Ramy,1,"Season 2 is moving and profane. Stupid funny, then scary serious. Topical and evergreen. Hyperspecific with wide appeal.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16936,Ramy,1,"For everyone else, though, Ramy is most interesting and most arresting in the way it tells separate stories, finding flaws and humor and humanity for its minor characters in ways it often struggles to do for its main character.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16937,Ramy,0,"Even one great supporting performance, itself overcoming a relatively one-note character, doesn't make the season any less disappointing.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16938,Ramy,1,"The show is a wonderful celebration of faith and trying to be a better person. Even with some miscalculations along the way, the second season is on par with the first and continues to be a powerful comedy that deserves your attention.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16939,Ramy,1,"Ramy is still one of the freshest, thought-provoking comedies of the streaming era.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16940,Ramy,1,"""Ramy"" holds a strong footing as a deep dive into a rarely represented community, while parsing through the complexities of what it means to be a good Muslim man.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16941,Ramy,1,"One of the many strengths... is how its star and creator widens the focus beyond its eponymous character's own journey to reveal the challenges of assimilation for the rest of his family, each of whom takes center stage in impactful episodes of their own.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16942,Ramy,1,"The best television finds a way to make the specific universal and the universal specific. There is no other show quite like Ramy, because there is no other character quite like Ramy.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16943,Ramy,1,"...a charming, melancholy meditation on the verboten.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16944,Ramy,1,"Season two is moving, heartbreaking, and relevant. Just the right combination of what a perfect season looks like.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16945,Ramy,1,"Despite a couple of misses in the middle, season two is a remarkable experience that retains Ramy's charming storytelling and comedic nuances.",Hulu,96%,86%,41
16946,The Great,1,"McNamara’s writing remains cheekily brimful of lexical and copulatory energy, with added dabs of surrealism – witness the crocodile on the loose in the palace.",Hulu,94%,86%,29
16947,The Great,1,Season 2 of The Great leans into its most obvious asset: the delectably doltish turn by Nicholas Hoult as Russian emperor Peter.,Hulu,94%,86%,29
16948,The Great,1,"It's zany, hilarious, and at times, feels like an elaborate and ambitious workplace sitcom. In short, The Great was the show I was most eager to hit play on in 2021. Here's to creator and head writer Tony McNamara - huzzah!",Hulu,94%,86%,29
16949,The Great,1,The thing about The Great is that it's so delicious. It's so decadent. It's so naughty.,Hulu,94%,86%,29
16950,The Great,1,"Clever, irreverent, and touching, Season 2 establishes The Great as one of the best comedies on television right now. It strikes a perfect balance between humor and heartbreak -- a masterful feat.",Hulu,94%,86%,29

16953,The Great,1,This rambunctiously dark and anti-historical comedy from Australian playwright Tony McNamara has returned in brilliant style.,Hulu,94%,86%,29

16961,The Great,1,"Mind-boggling anachronistic, The Great is, at the very least, an original.",Hulu,94%,86%,29
16962,The Great,1,It's a place of elegance and rot and backstabbing and -- if all goes to plan -- maybe even a little hope. Keeping all these things constantly front of mind and close to heart is what makes The Great worth returning to again and again.,Hulu,94%,86%,29
16963,The Great,1,"The Great is funnier than ever, bolstered by clever, tongue-in-cheek dialogue, solid writing and stunning cinematography.",Hulu,94%,86%,29
16964,The Great,1,"That doubling-down on ahistorical fun works again in The Great Season 2, but the cheekiness of now being ""entirely untrue"" brings the show dangerously close to wearing out its welcome.",Hulu,94%,86%,29
16965,The Great,1,"It may not be exactly true, in other words, but neither is it untrue. It's a riot, in every way imaginable and a lot of fun. And for that let us say huzzah!",Hulu,94%,86%,29

17227,Superstore,1,"As Superstore comes to an end, it's too late to give it all the flowers it deserves, but it's not too late to uphold it as having set a standard for the TV sitcom, particularly of the workplace variety.",Peacock,93%,79%,15
17228,Superstore,1,"That Superstore is so soothing is largely down to the enduring delightfulness of America Ferrera as Amy, a slightly put-upon worker at a Midwestern big-box store that serves as an employer of last resort for numerous misfits and weirdos.",Peacock,93%,79%,15

17334,The Affair,1,"I'd probably follow these characters (even Whitney) for an indefinite number of seasons - partly because of the sucker that I am, but also because ""The Affair"" can never be completely considered down for the count.",Peacock,86%,77%,16

17423,The Thing About Pam,1,"Maybe it’s a good thing to be so unmoored by a TV show. For better or worse, that destabilization, that determined desire for clarity on what this show is, will keep me watching. Yet another one of The Thing About Pam’s surprises.",Peacock,48%,54%,25

17425,The Thing About Pam,1,"Hats off to Renée Zellweger to go all out in portraying the frumpily sinister Pam Hupp. Not only is it a more accurate representation of its suburban Midwest setting, it’s far more entertaining than any number of sleek, coastal Nicole Kidman cable series.",Peacock,48%,54%,25

17435,The Thing About Pam,0,Zellweger is simultaneously broadly cartoonish and blandly nonspecific. She squints so much that her eyes lose whatever interiority they might have reflected; there is no real difference between her smile or her frown.,Peacock,48%,54%,25
17436,The Thing About Pam,0,There’s a lot of blurriness of intention around the storytelling in The Thing About Pam and an ultimately complacent belief that Renée Zellweger slurping on soda is enough to count as Emmy bait.,Peacock,48%,54%,25
17437,The Thing About Pam,1,"Zellweger, in her biggest TV role so far, looks like she is thoroughly enjoying her time as this larger-than-life character, whose boldness knew no end until she was finally made to face the consequences of her crime streak.",Peacock,48%,54%,25
17438,The Thing About Pam,0,"When the Coen Brothers-inspired tone works, it's deliciously satisfying. But then you remember that this entertainingly stranger-than-fiction story wouldn't exist if innocent people hadn't died, and you feel little queasy.",Peacock,48%,54%,25

17456,Bel-Air,1,"Bel-Air has the potential to truly stand on its own if it doesn’t try to be to cute with its ties to The Fresh Prince. From what we’ve seen in the first episode, it’s well on its way to doing that.",Peacock,66%,71%,47
17457,Bel-Air,1,"The main Banks making the series work is Jabari, the newcomer playing the fictional Will Smith. He has a lively swagger that emerges more readily as the series goes on.",Peacock,66%,71%,47

17459,Bel-Air,1,"Overall “Bel-Air” is its own, surprisingly engaging production. What it does have fully in common with its predecessor is that even as it remains entertaining, it still has much more to say.",Peacock,66%,71%,47

17467,Bel-Air,1,"Fantastic update that works on two levels - nostalgia for the original sitcom while also a great soap opera in the vein of another 90s hit, Beverly Hills 90210.  Also very topical without being preachy. Will vs Carlton is the biggest change, but it works.",Peacock,66%,71%,47
17468,Bel-Air,1,Its interesting how well Bel-Air remixes and plays around with what we know. The characters never feel unfamiliar but theyre also different enough to be an interesting watch.,Peacock,66%,71%,47

17547,Killing It,1,"Killing It gets off to a rough but promising start, thanks to a fun performance from Robinson, with an assist from O’Doherty. We hope that as the story gets more personal, the characters will outshine the gags.",Peacock,88%,61%,8

17579,Battlestar Galactica,1,"The mutiny storyline was the highlight of the season, which overall had an unusual number of highs and lows - there were very strong episodes and storylines throughout, but usually some noteworthy weaker elements would also show up along the way.",Peacock,95%,94%,38
17580,Battlestar Galactica,1,"With a renewed sense of purpose and enthusiasm season four is more cohesive and creatively invigorating than the third installment of the series, which often felt disjointed and needlessly didactic.",Peacock,95%,94%,38
17581,Battlestar Galactica,1,"This final season of BSG surely contains many faults, most of which are the direct result of mysteries the show had imposed on itself. But when it comes time to send off the crew of Galactica, it is done in the small moments, just as it should be.",Peacock,95%,94%,38
17582,Battlestar Galactica,1,"It's a relief to have the series back to pick up a strange, uneven TV season.",Peacock,95%,94%,38
17583,Battlestar Galactica,1,The return of Battlestar Galactica reminds us why it's so often considered one of the best shows on television.,Peacock,95%,94%,38
17584,Battlestar Galactica,1,"Most of what's in these ten episodes seems designed to get your hopes up even while the showrunners are busy dashing them, and perhaps most noticeable is the fact that the show has become more depressing and fatalistic than ever.",Peacock,95%,94%,38
17585,Battlestar Galactica,1,"There was some disappointment, yes, but god damned the episode was absolutely breathtaking. On the whole, it was a relatively worthy conclusion to a groundbreaking series, albeit with a manipulative coda.",Peacock,95%,94%,38
17586,Battlestar Galactica,1,"After anxious months of geeky Web speculation over how Battlestar's final season will conclude, the best thing about ""He That Believeth in Me"" was how it bypassed our feverish expectations and instead set up new central conflicts.",Peacock,95%,94%,38
17587,Battlestar Galactica,1,"The series continues to transcend the sci-fi genre and bring out real emotions, social issues and conflict.",Peacock,95%,94%,38

17589,Battlestar Galactica,1,I don't mean to sound flippant. I kind of like the audacity of a sci-fi series getting this explicitly spiritual in explaining its mythology.,Peacock,95%,94%,38
17590,Battlestar Galactica,1,"For a series that had always used familiar trappings of sci-fi like robots and spaceships to comment on our present-day circumstances, it was the perfect final sequence.",Peacock,95%,94%,38
17591,Battlestar Galactica,1,"Tonight's Battlestar Galactica finale was a cop out, but it was also the perfect goodbye. Ron Moore dropped the ball on plot but as always, the show delivered where it really mattered.",Peacock,95%,94%,38
17592,Battlestar Galactica,1,"So, overall, I was fully satisfied with the ending, and I don't feel like I wasted four seasons of televisions.",Peacock,95%,94%,38

17594,Battlestar Galactica,0,"To be honest, I'm weary of Baltar and his endless visions/hallucinations, as I am of the fleet's wandering as the surviving colonists try, somewhat fitfully, to find their way back to a home planet none of them remembers.",Peacock,95%,94%,38
17595,Battlestar Galactica,1,"Season Four, broadcast in two chunks with a climbing-the-wall break due to the writers' strike, proved the most challenging, soul-searching and devastatingly turbulent yet.",Peacock,95%,94%,38
17596,Battlestar Galactica,1,"The thing with shows such as BSG and the brilliant cop drama The Wire is that they set the bar so high in terms of sheer entertainment, that it is almost impossible for them to consistently deliver the levels of excellence we've greedily come to expect.",Peacock,95%,94%,38
17597,Battlestar Galactica,1,"Yes there were missteps, but this will be remembered as a show delivering compelling, emotional moments in nearly every episode, along with some of the most layered and thought-provoking situations and characters you'd find on television.",Peacock,95%,94%,38

17600,Battlestar Galactica,1,"Much has been made of the show's embrace of major social themes and plot points that recalled current events, but it also combined a heady brew of pulp fiction, religious mysticism and solid character drama.",Peacock,95%,94%,38
17601,Battlestar Galactica,0,A lot of basic and mundane things don't add up for me.,Peacock,95%,94%,38
17602,Battlestar Galactica,1,"My take on the Battlestar Galactica series finale was that it was 99% incredibly satisfying and delivered beyond what I was hoping for. In the end, it seems destiny will be what it will be, much like fighting gravity.",Peacock,95%,94%,38
17603,Battlestar Galactica,1,"Somehow, out of all the doom and gloom, death, destruction and nihilism we've had, Battlestar Galactica finished with something approaching a happy ending.",Peacock,95%,94%,38

17617,Two and a Half Men,1,"Was it appropriate? Classy? I just know I laughed. Great TV or no, Two and a Half Men ended its many lucrative years in a way true to its nature: going for the punchlines, laughing at death, as expensive objects rained from the sky.",Peacock,65%,66%,12

17657,Bates Motel,1,I came late to the Bates Motel saga not having discovered the show until the third season. What pulled me in was Norma and Norman's weird and wacky relationship. You couldn't have one without the other.,Peacock,93%,91%,21

17660,Bates Motel,1,"In its final season, Bates Motel proved over and over again that it is one of the few series on television that can simultaneously subvert predictions, exceed expectations and make every shocking twist feel completely earned.",Peacock,93%,91%,21
17661,Bates Motel,1,This final season was thoughtful and provocative end to a complex multi-year tragedy.,Peacock,93%,91%,21

17663,Bates Motel,1,"Of course, the fun in Bates Motel is in perverting that sweetness until its outright rancid, but The Cord wants viewers to remember that this was a show that was driven by love at the end of the day.",Peacock,93%,91%,21

17671,Bates Motel,1,"While season 5 appears poised to tell the story of a schizophrenic killer trying to remain in the shadows, what's even more exciting about the final chapter is that it's clear the exploration of Norman Bates is not yet complete.",Peacock,93%,91%,21

17678,Girls5eva,1,"Even if Girls5eva weren’t densely layered with witty pop cultural references in the manner of 30 Rock, so that rewatching is rewarding, and even if it weren’t buoyed by well-written awful songs... I’d be smitten thanks to the Goldsberry’s performance.",Peacock,96%,77%,17

17680,Girls5eva,1,"It’s not immediately delivering the kind of sublimely satirical songs that made the first season such a masterpiece. It’s still great fun, though, as the middle-aged survivors of ’90s girl band Girls5eva continue their shaky comeback.",Peacock,96%,77%,17
17681,Girls5eva,1,"Stick with it, and it turns out the plot arcs and emotional beats guiding the eight new episodes are rather solid...",Peacock,96%,77%,17

17694,30 Rock,0,"The good news is there's a host of amazing cameos from Salma Hayek, Julianne Moore... But they're sometimes not very funny, and the whole thing has the feel of a rushed comedy riff whipped off over too many cups of coffee.",Peacock,78%,93%,30
17695,30 Rock,1,"30 Rock could coast on the goodwill generated by the knockout, surprisingly moving Liz Lemon wedding episode but it seems intent on regaining its former glory as it roars its way to a conclusion.",Peacock,78%,93%,30
17696,30 Rock,1,"The best thing about the final season is that, like the entire series, it was never perfect. But the fact that it felt different than any other sitcom was part of its appeal. And that energy is evident in the final episodes.",Peacock,78%,93%,30
17697,30 Rock,1,"Uproariously funny and also -- dare I say it -- beautifully poignant. Well done, Lemon, well done. You'll get no eye-rolling from me.",Peacock,78%,93%,30

17699,30 Rock,1,"While many might have expected a sendoff in the fashion of the oft-compared-to Mary Tyler Moore Show, with the entire TGS family tearfully embracing as the studio goes dark, 30 Rock stayed true to its bizarre heart.",Peacock,78%,93%,30
17700,30 Rock,1,"Happily, Tina Fey is running this manic circus, rising to the occasion with a final hour of self-referential zaniness that finds many fruitfully funny and characteristically twisted variations on the theme of saying goodbye.",Peacock,78%,93%,30
17701,30 Rock,1,"Manages to maintain the joke-dense nature of 30 Rock to the very end, with enough callbacks to satisfy any fan. And the media satire is sharp to the very last.",Peacock,78%,93%,30
17702,30 Rock,1,"In taking on the greed, ineptitude and ego rampant in the boardroom, Fey created the most radically subversive satire of the oft-satirized TV business ever.",Peacock,78%,93%,30
17703,30 Rock,1,"At the moment, network TV is relatively rich with farce... 30 Rock operates at several orders of magnitude higher.",Peacock,78%,93%,30
17704,30 Rock,1,At its worst it was good. At its best it was transcendent. It's not enough to say that 30 Rock didn't die. Its whole life was thunder.,Peacock,78%,93%,30
17705,30 Rock,1,"On a purely joke-for-joke basis the seven seasons of Tina Fey's TV industry satire might be the best US sitcom of all time. Based on Fey's own experiences as a Saturday Night Live head writer, this was democratic ensemble farce of the highest calibre.",Peacock,78%,93%,30
17706,30 Rock,1,"As bright, light and taut as a miracle fiber. The jokes -- smart, surreal jabs at culture and politics -- never let up.",Peacock,78%,93%,30
17707,30 Rock,1,"Liz Lemon was flawed and complex, but she was also witty and smart and no-nonsense, especially when it came to herself. We relate to her because she made our most basic and common flaws hilarious to watch every week.",Peacock,78%,93%,30

17709,30 Rock,1,"It was one of the most satisfying sitcom enders I've seen, right up there with the end of The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Cheers, series that operated along the same no-fuss, let's-all-have-a-good-time wavelength.",Peacock,78%,93%,30

17711,30 Rock,1,"No show before 30 Rock commented as astutely on television culture as it mocked NBC and terrible TV trends (""MILF Island,"" anyone?). For that alone, 30 Rock deserves the thanks of a grateful nation.",Peacock,78%,93%,30
17712,30 Rock,1,"Through seven seasons, loving ""30 Rock"" always seemed like evidence that one's brain and heart were connected perfectly.",Peacock,78%,93%,30
17713,30 Rock,1,"What I'll miss most when 30 Rock is gone is the conduit it provided into whatever was on Fey's mind. As 30 Rock found its way and sharpened its blade, Fey became the unofficial spokeswoman for a niche demographic.",Peacock,78%,93%,30
17714,30 Rock,1,"Man, with 30 Rock almost over, who will we look to on NBC to mercilessly mock NBC?",Peacock,78%,93%,30
17715,30 Rock,1,The anchor of 30 Rock has always been the friendship between Liz Lemon and Jack Donaghy which is a pairing that has only gotten stronger now that there's mutual respect between them.,Peacock,78%,93%,30
17716,30 Rock,1,"So: funny funny, and full of well-chosen guest appearances and cameos. But above all there was a sweetness to the episode.",Peacock,78%,93%,30
17717,30 Rock,1,"All great things must come to an end, and 6 1/2 seasons seems like a reasonable life span for this great thing -- packed with wordplay, sight gags, pop-culture tangents and assorted other odds and ends.",Peacock,78%,93%,30
17718,30 Rock,1,I respect Tina Fey's desire to end the show while it's still good. But an episode like this one just reminds me of how much I'm going to miss 30 Rock when it's gone.,Peacock,78%,93%,30
17719,30 Rock,1,"I suspect that much of this season will be about Lemon and Jack trying to tank the network, and that promises to be a comedy goldmine.",Peacock,78%,93%,30
17720,30 Rock,1,"Live From Studio 6H was one of if not the funniest episode of the season, and the concept was also on point.",Peacock,78%,93%,30
17721,30 Rock,1,"Each episode of 30 Rock suggests a Hollywood blockbuster condensed to a half-hour, every sensible plot development seemingly replaced by an absurd twist.",Peacock,78%,93%,30
17722,30 Rock,1,Looks like Liz Lemon's going out in a blaze of glory. Blerg...we miss her already.,Peacock,78%,93%,30
17723,Psych,1,"The outing is not immune to the overall sloppiness that crept into Psych in its later years, but it's sweet and appropriately conclusive - and it has enough of the series' early virtues to remind those who liked it what they liked about it.",Peacock,89%,93%,10
17724,Psych,1,"I reckon everyone who watched ""Lock, Stock"" had [a] smashing time anyway.",Peacock,89%,93%,10

17726,Psych,1,"Psych opened its eighth season with an episode that was largely a standalone, Juliet-less outing removed from continuity...yet one that was a special kind of ""magical"" nonetheless.",Peacock,89%,93%,10
17727,Psych,1,"It was probably a good thing that Psych didn't attempt a big, splashy finale. The dressed-down version was the perfect way to end this series, to bookend what Psych was always about: relationships between characters and a boy growing up.",Peacock,89%,93%,10
17728,Psych,1,"It was mostly a fun ride which, also like Monk, managed to create a nifty ensemble as well.",Peacock,89%,93%,10
17729,Psych,1,"The real triumph of Psych is that it has lasted eight seasons, since it hails from a TV genre of absurd and sometimes silly humor that often wears out its welcome quickly.",Peacock,89%,93%,10
17730,Psych,1,"Few shows display the level of unbridled, free-form silliness that Psych had.",Peacock,89%,93%,10
17731,Psych,1,"To call an episode of Psych ""funny"" is kind of redundant. In fact, I think the dictionary should now just have a picture of Shawn and Gus as the definition of the word ""funny.""",Peacock,89%,93%,10

17733,The Endgame,1,"This is pretty standard primetime crime/thriller fare, but its twist has potential.",Peacock,33%,83%,12
17734,The Endgame,0,"Sure its fun to watch Baccarin regard Bathe with the same kind of amused regard an older brother gives to his younger siblings attempts at tackling him, but it gives The Endgame zero sense of stakes.",Peacock,33%,83%,12
17735,The Endgame,0,"We’ve been down this road before, but at least this one is paved in Baccarin’s dark lipstick and wry, self-assured grins.",Peacock,33%,83%,12
17736,The Endgame,0,"The Endgame is the sort of show that believes it can compete with an international hit like Money Heist by staging seven simultaneous bank takeovers, while giving us precious little reason to care what happens in any of them.",Peacock,33%,83%,12
17737,The Endgame,0,"The Endgame is by turns boring and by other turns generic and nonsensical. Its story isn’t compelling enough to follow beyond the first episode, and we’re figuring that the interplay between its stars isn’t enough to keep people watching.",Peacock,33%,83%,12
17738,The Endgame,1,"The Endgame makes enough of the right moves to inspire curiosity about where this intricate scheme ultimately leads. While it doesn't tell you much about its endgame, as this sort of exercise goes, that's a good place to start.",Peacock,33%,83%,12
17739,The Endgame,0,"It all looks quite sleek and impressive, but even after just two episodes, Elena’s ability to pull off the impossible out of nowhere begins to get old.",Peacock,33%,83%,12
17740,The Endgame,0,"There are no visual ideas here, no narrative ideas and no core performances to keep you watching while waiting for those other attributes to emerge.",Peacock,33%,83%,12
17741,The Endgame,1,"Conceptually familiar, narratively overambitious, and yet somehow still enjoyable... defies easy dismissal thanks to the uncontainable charisma of Morena Baccarin.",Peacock,33%,83%,12
17742,The Endgame,0,It's laughable rather than intimidating.,Peacock,33%,83%,12
17743,The Endgame,1,"The Endgame is a crackerjack of a caper show, a tautly edited blend of action and wit that blows along like a runaway train.",Peacock,33%,83%,12
17744,The Endgame,0,"Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathe, longtime supporting players getting starring roles in a large-scale series for the first time, do not feel irreplaceable, and the show's clunky, obvious writing doesn't give them much to work with.",Peacock,33%,83%,12
17745,A.P. Bio,1,"This kind of humor, rife with wackiness and second-hand embarrassment, has become a trademark of the series and the laughs are nearly always on point, even when viewers are wincing at the same time.",Peacock,88%,87%,1
17746,Heroes,0,"Once again, then, an error-riddled and confusingly-plotted episode of Heroes where everyone acted out of character, which, by this point, can be considered entirely consistent with their previous appearances.",Peacock,52%,65%,7
17747,Heroes,0,"Maybe I'm coming off a little harsh, but after so many years of mediocre storytelling and promises of things being better, I'm over it.",Peacock,52%,65%,7
17748,Heroes,1,"With the fourth and final season going back to basics, as well as injecting some much needed warmth and depth into several previously underdeveloped characters, Heroes definitely went out with a bang.",Peacock,52%,65%,7
17749,Heroes,1,"Season 4 was not the rebirth of Heroes, but it improved the series enough to prove that there is still a lot of potential.",Peacock,52%,65%,7
17750,Heroes,0,"The fourth season of Heroes ended not with a bang, not with a whimper, but with a collective synchronized shrug.",Peacock,52%,65%,7
17751,Heroes,0,It's legitimately incomprehensible that the show's producers have jobs.,Peacock,52%,65%,7
17752,Heroes,0,"Ideas so ill-conceived and poorly executed, you'd think the show was written by committee and the writers had given up-really been phonin' it in there for quite some time.",Peacock,52%,65%,7
17753,The Purge,1,This season knows how to combine the suburban nightmare of the first part with the frenetic sequences and the political and social complications. [Full Review in Spanish],Peacock,42%,70%,4
17754,The Purge,1,"The shift effectively creates a brave new world... where the writers are given a chance to more fully explore the consequences of that single 12-hour period, and to draw a more complete picture of a world.",Peacock,42%,70%,4
17755,The Purge,1,"The acting throughout is solid, and Tim Andrew has always been a reliable hand in the director's chair, both with actors and with the general feel and tone of an episode.",Peacock,42%,70%,4
17756,The Purge,1,"Yes, we got subjected to another round of kill or be killed on Purge night, but the promise of The Purge Season 2 Episode 1 is that with another 364 days to go before the commencement of the next Purge, we're in unfamiliar territory.",Peacock,42%,70%,4
17757,Brave New World,0,"Despite some evocative (and provocative) visuals and appropriate dramatic tension, it fails to truly excite.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17758,Brave New World,1,"To the likely dismay of Huxley purists, Peacock's Brave New World is sexy, gorgeous, and exciting, a feast of visual and sensory delights that's often purposely empty in its portrayal of purposely empty people.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17759,Brave New World,0,"It's just never compelling, never engrossing and, worst of all, not thought-provoking to the degree it needs to be given its subject matter and acclaimed, if dated, source material.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17760,Brave New World,1,"Although [Alden Ehrenreich] again does not have a hit on his hands (the series got cancelled after one season), Brave New World remains a watchable escapist fantasy.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17761,Brave New World,1,"Regardless of whether you are familiar with the novel or not, this is a world that is very easy to escape into, and by doing so the series demands we ask bigger questions about the nature of escape itself.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17762,Brave New World,1,Dystopian sci-fi series is heavy on sex and violence.,Peacock,46%,79%,56
17763,Brave New World,0,Disastrously walked into every known pitfall of trying to turn what is essentially a philosophical discourse into gripping drama. Even mediocre drama would have been a start.,Peacock,46%,79%,56

17766,Brave New World,0,"Miniseries that scratches on Aldous Huxley's novel, staying on the surface. [Full review in Spanish]",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17767,Brave New World,1,"Made with great visual oomph and a clever tweaking of Huxley's plotting, it is, ironically, top-grade escapism while lingering on Huxley's satiric depiction of a society soothed and manipulated by pleasure and drugs.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17768,Brave New World,0,"The constant writhing of beautiful bodies isn't enough to keep the interest in a show with a plotline as thin as ice. Lazy writing with no engaging qualities leaves this one, one tough pill to swallow.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17769,Brave New World,0,"The cast is good. The writing is mediocre. It hews closely to Aldous Huxley's novel, except when it departs from it. There are a surprisingly large amount of orgies, and yet, they are in no way the reason to watch or not to watch Brave New World.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17770,Brave New World,0,Brave New World is all flash and no substance. It looks good but that's about as far as it goes. It isn't really interested in getting too deep into how the world operates because that's not where its priorities lie.,Peacock,46%,79%,56
17771,Brave New World,0,"Temperamentally so right-wing that I wish it were better. As it is, the series is merely tolerable, hampered by a lead-you-around-by-the-nose quality that is more in keeping with the network-TV ethos than with top-shelf cable drama.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17772,Brave New World,0,"Not only have we had a ton of sci-fi dystopias lately, but Huxley's novel is one of the most popular and enduring ever; most of the stuff you're sick of was already cribbed from it in the first place. That puts this new series in a tricky position",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17773,Brave New World,1,"As far as summer shows go, Brave New World might be ideal, and it scores points because it can be appreciated on multiple levels.",Peacock,46%,79%,56

17779,Brave New World,1,"Brave New World offers a relatively breezy way to examine timeless issues of class consciousness and escapism, just relevant enough to not feel like the meaningless amusements it preaches against.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17780,Brave New World,0,"Slick, expensive-looking and with the biggest name behind it, ""Brave"" should have been Peacock's best offering, but instead is its biggest flop.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17781,Brave New World,0,"Sadly, beyond those genre departures that seem like, let's be honest, products of inconsistent tone in the show's writing and direction, Brave New World doesn't offer much.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17782,Brave New World,1,"With fresh plotting, an expanded focus, and after updating a few outdated themes, this ""Brave New World"" is very different from the book. But when you're trying to make a new thing out of an old thing, that can be OK.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17783,Brave New World,0,"While it looks pretty, it feels thin. Entire stretches are given over to PG-rated orgies instead of clearly explaining the plot. Moreover, a TV series where audiences are supposed to sympathize with the bored and unhappy one percent feels out of touch.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17784,Brave New World,1,"Interesting looking and provocative in its themes, Brave New World starts out with considerable promise and doesn't end nearly as well; still, at least the show feels big, strange and slightly different.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17785,Brave New World,0,"Welcome to this not-so Brave New World, where all the ideas feel old and not nearly as deeply considered as the creators think. But, hey, at least it all looks fabulous.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17786,Brave New World,0,"It spends so much time reveling in its own aesthetic that dramatic momentum becomes an afterthought. At the same time, there are real ideas contained within the nine-part series. Some of them are actually in the book.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17787,Brave New World,1,Brave New World succeeds mostly as a rainbow-colored spectacle one can easily sit with despite the violence and empty sex appeal... or perhaps because of it.,Peacock,46%,79%,56
17788,Brave New World,0,The idea of a society where pandemics have been completely eradicated may sound ideal in this particular moment. But that's the only attractive I could find in Brave New World's utopic setting. [Full Review in Spanish],Peacock,46%,79%,56

17790,Brave New World,0,"This adaptation looks great but is definitively hollow, and in turn all of its parties, extensive discussions, and choreographed orgy scenes become simply exhausting.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17791,Brave New World,0,"Huxley's novel was revolutionary when it was published nearly 90 years ago, but the show has turned it into just another piece of consumer content.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17792,Brave New World,0,Brave New World plays it safe and rehearses empty criticisms that are undone by its own content and platform.,Peacock,46%,79%,56
17793,Brave New World,1,"Brave New World is begging for discussion, and there's a lot to unpack.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17794,Brave New World,1,"There's a lot of talk about the ""social body"" in a lavish new limited-series adaptation of Brave New World... But it's the many scantily clad bodies writhing in orgiastic abandon that you might remember after watching this sleek and sensual depiction.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17795,Brave New World,0,"As it unfolds, ""Brave New World"" fits only the most nebulous sense of the word ""interesting,"" with its most relevant commentary left behind in the Savage Lands.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17796,Brave New World,1,"""Brave New World"" isn't bad - what remain of Huxley's central ideas here are still relevant and important. They're just presented in a such a muted way you wind up thinking of another Rolling Stones song, about wanting more satisfaction.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17797,Brave New World,0,There's nothing brave or new to see here.,Peacock,46%,79%,56
17798,Brave New World,0,"The nine-part debut season feels like it's built on miscalculation atop miscalculation, but the gravest one is that the citizens of New London are effectively extraterrestrials.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17799,Brave New World,0,"For the most part, we're left with an unsexy portrait of decadence, a thriller without thrills, a prescription that's less soma than Sominex.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17800,Brave New World,0,"It's not an immediately gripping techno-satire, nor a mindbending puzzle box. It's not an impressive sci-fi world, nor a bold piece of sex-violence-profanity prestige. It's just a disappointing adaptation trying to be everything for everyone.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17801,Brave New World,1,"Whether by showrunner David Weiner's design or network notes, the show lightens up, allowing for more moments of dark humor but also some weird character turns.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17802,Brave New World,1,"A well-made, thoughtful show, succumbing only occasionally to the silliness of its extreme premise. That is about as much as you can ask from a debuting drama series in this moment of content.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17803,Brave New World,1,"Though the ""Westworld"" parallel applies to the affluent creeps-exploiting-the-poor in an amusement park narrative, ""Brave New World"" is much more rewarding to watch.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17804,Brave New World,0,"The series looks gorgeous, and expensive, even if its sci-fi brutalist aesthetic is a bit generic. The performances are solid, too... Yet something is missing from the show's core... I struggled to get invested in this bunch.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17805,Brave New World,1,"By the time the romantic triangle heats up, Brave New World has successfully put the ""soap"" back in ""dystopia."" I swear that pun works if you take the right pills.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17806,Brave New World,1,"...don't expect to hear Huxley's famous phrase ""orgy-porgy,"" nor is there much use of a scent organ to rev up the alphas and beta pluses pushing them into a frothy sexual peak. There's no sex hormone chewing gum, either-such a pity.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17807,Brave New World,0,"Both Brown Findlay and Ehrenreich seem frustratingly tamped-down here... No wonder the actors seem exhausted; their project, deep into its first season, doesn't know what kind of show it wants to be.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17808,Brave New World,1,"Brave New World is essentially an analysis of compassion ⁠and how much the constructs of our society can get in the way of that. Amid a global pandemic and countless other issues in our world, that sentiment feels more relevant than ever.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17809,Brave New World,1,"Brave New World is less about philosophy and more about slick, sexy sci-fi storytelling. It's not high art, but it is a truly fun and raucous watch.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17810,Brave New World,1,"It's a well-made and thought-provoking adaptation, even if it could be a little braver.",Peacock,46%,79%,56
17811,Brave New World,0,Brave New World has too many parts out of place to be a success - and stripped out one of the most important parts that would have made it a success.,Peacock,46%,79%,56
17812,Brave New World,1,Brave New World is summer viewing at it's finest: decadent and sexy with just enough depth to keep you engaged during the hottest days of the year.,Peacock,46%,79%,56
17813,Dr. Death,1,"Grim viewing — and gripping, anxiety-riddled, cliffhanger-filled and highly bingeable viewing, too.",Peacock,92%,85%,25
17814,Dr. Death,1,Driven by Joshua Jackson's surprising performance. [Full review in Spanish],Peacock,92%,85%,25
17815,Dr. Death,1,Jackson is great as a wannabe genius descending into a self-created hell.,Peacock,92%,85%,25
17816,Dr. Death,1,"As this compelling series reminds us time and time again, despite Duntsch's obvious personality issues, the true villain of the piece is the system that let him practice for so long, and continues to allow other equally dangerous medics to do so.",Peacock,92%,85%,25
17817,Dr. Death,1,"While this summer's horror movies are doing their best to scare us, none of them will come close to giving me the chills that the operating room scenes in the new Peacock series ""Dr. Death"" do.",Peacock,92%,85%,25
17818,Dr. Death,1,"Digging into Christopher Duntsch's personal and professional life, Dr. Death paints a detailed portrait of a possible sociopath.",Peacock,92%,85%,25
17819,Dr. Death,1,"There are times where it feels like the show is preying on you. There are repeated loud, visceral surgery scenes where bones crack and blood gushes.",Peacock,92%,85%,25
17820,Dr. Death,1,"Director of the first two episodes, Maggie Kiley (Dirty John) does a magnificent job of throwing the audience into the unfolding mystery and horror as Henderson and company uncover the full extent of Duntsch's malpractices.",Peacock,92%,85%,25
17821,Dr. Death,1,"Dr. Death is as entertaining as it is enraging, although anyone with a history of dealing with inadequate medical professionals may find it triggering (also triggering is the sound that surgical hammers make when striking the spine).",Peacock,92%,85%,25
17822,Dr. Death,1,"We have a lot of reservations about Dr. Death, but considering the show will examine just how a butcher like Duntsch can keep getting hired by major hospitals who should be vetting their hires better, we'll keep watching.",Peacock,92%,85%,25
17823,Dr. Death,1,"Hats off to Macmanus and directors Maggie Kiley, Jennifer Morrison and So Yong Kim for their ambitious vision, not to mention the ace cast. At the same time, it's a shame that Dr. Death is too often so dull.",Peacock,92%,85%,25
17824,Dr. Death,1,"Jackson captures Duntsch's god complex and fragile ego, and while this means it's going to be easy to hate the doctor with every fiber of your being, that's the point.",Peacock,92%,85%,25
17825,Dr. Death,1,"Dr. Death succeeds at presenting us with a dark, terrifying story complete with one hell of a villain. There's no doubt that Joshua Jackson is perfectly cast. It'll take some time before I'm ready to see him in anything else.",Peacock,92%,85%,25
17826,Dr. Death,1,"This adaptation manages to improve on its source material, perhaps because the story of Dr. Christopher Duntsch is so monstrous, it must be seen to be believed.",Peacock,92%,85%,25
17827,Dr. Death,1,"It hardly matters if the series around him understands Duntsch, because Jackson plays him with chilling consistency, so committed to his character's commitment to his own brilliance and infallibility that you occasionally find yourself believing.",Peacock,92%,85%,25
17828,Dr. Death,1,The limited series is more unnerving than any horror movie.,Peacock,92%,85%,25
17829,Dr. Death,1,"Dr. Death is an easy binge, but a hard watch. The traumatizing surgeries are just that, and Jackson finds just the right balance of dark ambiguity in his performance.",Peacock,92%,85%,25
17830,Dr. Death,1,"The series' excursions into Duntsch's past make the emerging picture all the more disturbing. With roles for the likes of Kelsey Grammer and Grace Gummer, it's highly bingeable stuff.",Peacock,92%,85%,25
17831,Dr. Death,1,The generally underrated Joshua Jackson carries Dr. Death with a fascinating blend of idiotic confidence and nonchalant sociopathology.,Peacock,92%,85%,25
17832,Dr. Death,0,"Despite the show's few thrills, its structure only reveals an unsteady grasp of the story at its center.",Peacock,92%,85%,25
17833,Dr. Death,1,"The most striking aspect of this story, perhaps, is the current of plausibility that runs through it all, that says this is what can happen, this is what did happen to the victims of someone revered as an authority, like Duntsch.",Peacock,92%,85%,25
17834,Dr. Death,1,The what and the how are harrowing enough. Dr. Death succeeds by focusing on the people who fought for years to make sure Christopher Duntsch could do no more harm.,Peacock,92%,85%,25
17835,Dr. Death,1,"The show offers a stark warning that viewers will surely keep in mind the next time they require surgery, no matter how routine.",Peacock,92%,85%,25
17836,Dr. Death,1,"With an ending that anyone could easily Google, Dr. Death still manages to keep you engaged to find out if Duntsch gets what is coming to him.",Peacock,92%,85%,25
17837,Dr. Death,0,"Duntsch never adds up to a character we can understand, and standing back and wondering just how far beyond our understanding some people can be doesn't fly as the takeaway for eight hours' worth of entertainment.",Peacock,92%,85%,25
17838,Weeds,0,"Pour one out to Showtime's Weeds, y'all. But not the good stuff. The show no longer deserves it.",Peacock,70%,77%,10
17839,Weeds,0,"The show had been through so many time jumps and location changes, it was hard to know which state or decade we were supposed to be in, and even harder to care.",Peacock,70%,77%,10
17840,Weeds,0,Almost completely misses.,Peacock,70%,77%,10
17841,Weeds,1,"The entire premiere was a win for Weeds, which has had a rough past few seasons. But if there's any time to get the show back on track, it is now -- just in time for a proper ending.",Peacock,70%,77%,10
17842,Weeds,0,"What was once a contained and quirky -- though sometimes dark -- comedy about a mess of a woman, has become a global disaster.",Peacock,70%,77%,10
17843,Weeds,0,I'm pretty sure there aren't drugs strong enough to get me to the bittersweet end of this series.,Peacock,70%,77%,10
17844,Weeds,1,"While I wouldn't say I'm optimistic about this season, the certainty of its place in Weeds' larger narrative makes it considerably more palatable.",Peacock,70%,77%,10
17845,Weeds,1,"Weeds does manage to maintain the dry humor that made it a hit to begin with, and this isn't the brand of listless cynicism we get from lesser comedy writers content to appear savvy and hip.",Peacock,70%,77%,10
17846,Weeds,1,"I'm all in for the final season, I'll do my best to keep an open mind, but perhaps Weeds and Nancy would have been best served if they were not revived.",Peacock,70%,77%,10
17847,Weeds,0,It felt like the Weeds finale could have been more focused and a bit more eventful.,Peacock,70%,77%,10
17848,Monk,1,There are many fabulous stand-alone episodes in season eight.,Peacock,91%,89%,11
17849,Monk,1,"It's the TV equivalent of comfort food, and there aren't many shows you can say that about anymore. Now there's one less.",Peacock,91%,89%,11
17850,Monk,1,Everything neatly wrapped up - just like Monk folding his laundry.,Peacock,91%,89%,11
17851,Monk,1,"I won't miss Monk all that terribly, but I will miss knowing that the show was out there, creating a safe haven for people who just wanted a few smiles on a Friday night.",Peacock,91%,89%,11
17852,Monk,1,The performance that Tony Shalhoub gave as a close-to-death Monk was simply amazing.,Peacock,91%,89%,11
17853,Monk,1,"Here's to you Mr. Monk, a small and steady light on an often blinding, hyperkinetic screen. In your own quiet way, you have changed our lives and you will be missed.",Peacock,91%,89%,11
17854,Monk,1,Monk slowly evolved from a tightly-constructed mystery show into a more entertaining character study.,Peacock,91%,89%,11
17855,Monk,1,"Like a great old band going for one final tour, the final season of Monk promises to play all the greatest hits and go out on a high note.",Peacock,91%,89%,11
17856,Monk,0,"So, in its final season, Monk stays close to the formula that made it successful, offering more of the same.",Peacock,91%,89%,11
17857,Monk,0,"The finale summed up the reasons why lots of people loved this series, and why I and other people thought it had all become repetitive and silly.",Peacock,91%,89%,11
17858,Monk,1,"A good balance for the final season, giving fans time to enjoy some of the typical, lighter mystery-of-the-week episodes and then wrapping the series up by tying together all of the loose ends with Monk and the other characters.",Peacock,91%,89%,11
17859,Covert Affairs,1,Please let there be a sixth season of Covert Affairs. I need to know if Annie wears a gun under her wedding dress.,Peacock,93%,77%,8
17860,Covert Affairs,1,"Episode 16 was for the most part, a low-key season finale. The writers did really well bringing a lot of stories to a potential close. It was a bit worrying that the wrap-up didn't kick in until the final 10 minutes.",Peacock,93%,77%,8
17861,Covert Affairs,1,"Full of implausibilities, but engaging all the same.",Peacock,93%,77%,8
17862,Covert Affairs,1,"This season of Covert Affairs is going to be the first one without a Henry Wilcox storyline, and I couldn't be happier.",Peacock,93%,77%,8
17863,Covert Affairs,1,"The evil terrorist forces of the world are obviously ready, considering the explosive nature of the episode.",Peacock,93%,77%,8
17864,Covert Affairs,1,"The season premiere was a well-paced introductory episode which effectively brought Annie back, while launching a new mystery and case.",Peacock,93%,77%,8
17865,Covert Affairs,1,[Annie's] assignment takes a twist that should keep the agency on edge for most of the season. I'm in.,Peacock,93%,77%,8
17866,Covert Affairs,1,"Not a bad start to Season 5, Covert Affairs. Not bad at all.",Peacock,93%,77%,8
17867,Treadstone,1,"Spy fun, but don't say the B-word.",Peacock,47%,72%,19
17868,Treadstone,1,"It's like a Jason Bourne movie squared, cubed and extruded every which way as this compelling new series takes Robert Ludlum's Bourne trilogy mythology to places it's never been.",Peacock,47%,72%,19
17869,Treadstone,0,It's all a clone of the same idea. [Full Review in Spanish],Peacock,47%,72%,19
17870,Treadstone,0,Kring still hasn't figured out that momentum isn't the same thing as complexity...,Peacock,47%,72%,19
17871,Treadstone,0,"On a technical level, Treadstone has a lot going for it. The action quality is there. The bombastic energy is there. The espionage element is there. But, the show really needs to shed its unwillingness to be a part of the universe audiences know and love.",Peacock,47%,72%,19
17872,Treadstone,0,"Disappointing action spin-off is violent, has cursing.",Peacock,47%,72%,19
17873,Treadstone,0,"As spy dramas go, this one is better left out in the cold.",Peacock,47%,72%,19
17874,Treadstone,1,"It is fine for what it is, but nothing about it really justifies it's existence. You won't be bored watching Treadstone but you may not stick with it long enough to get the answers you seek.",Peacock,47%,72%,19
17875,Treadstone,1,"In Treadstone we have more distraction than emotional resonance, sold with the fantasy of precision-driven, expert violence. No doubt, this is a vintage approach. It also feels right for right now.",Peacock,47%,72%,19
17876,Treadstone,1,"I don't know how long an action series can keep this up, but the premiere, at least, is intense, mysterious, and oddly electrifying.",Peacock,47%,72%,19
17877,Treadstone,1,"The biggest positive about Treadstone is that it doesn't play out like a TV show. With the intense fight scenes, exhilarating chase sequences, and everything else, it felt like I was watching a big-budget movie.",Peacock,47%,72%,19
17878,Treadstone,1,"Parkouring its way on to screens with far more vim and purpose than one would expect, Treadstone is a scrappy but stimulating surprise and a refreshingly necessary addition to the saga.",Peacock,47%,72%,19
17879,Treadstone,0,"While the action in Treadstone is great, there just isn't enough plot to make a satisfying watch.",Peacock,47%,72%,19
17880,Treadstone,1,There's really only one thing you need to know about the new USA series Treadstone: the fight scenes are incredibly dope.,Peacock,47%,72%,19
17881,Treadstone,0,"While lots of action films require the audience to suspend disbelief at times, Treadstone requires them to saw the tops of their own heads off and remove the gooey blob inside. It's the only way you'll survive the writing.",Peacock,47%,72%,19
17882,Treadstone,1,"Treadstone proceeds a little too slowly in terms of connecting the dots, but the show doesn't scrimp on action, and those who enjoyed the movies should find tantalizing threads in this expansion of the narrative.",Peacock,47%,72%,19
17883,Treadstone,0,A forgettable espionage drama with a tenuous connection to a popular character who never appears and is never mentioned.,Peacock,47%,72%,19
17884,Treadstone,0,Treadstone... just treads a lot of narrative water.,Peacock,47%,72%,19
17885,Treadstone,0,"A show whose ambition to try to capture a world's worth of adventure seems, too often, like taking the easy way out from digging too deeply into story or character.",Peacock,47%,72%,19
17886,Joe vs Carole,0,"It isn't particularly entertaining, but chances are Joe vs. Carole will succeed at making you wonder why the series was even produced, let alone stretched over eight episodes.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17887,Joe vs Carole,0,"It's called Joe vs. Carole, but it should have been called Dumb vs Dumber.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17888,Joe vs Carole,0,"The series doesn’t know exactly what tone it wants to take. It kinda wants to be camp, but it kinda wants to be taken seriously, it kinda wants to give you just the facts ma’am, but it also kind of wants to show you different sides of these characters.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17889,Joe vs Carole,1,"My recommendation is to check it out for McKinnon and Mitchell, but after one episode you may have seen all you need. If you stick around for the full eight episodes, you will be entertained but you wont garner much else you didnt already know.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17890,Joe vs Carole,0,"Kate McKinnon and John Cameron Mitchell give it their best in a series that offers too little, too late.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17891,Joe vs Carole,0,"Later in the season, Joe yells, “Nobody watches ‘Duck Dynasty’ for the ducks!” This show is all ducks.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17892,Joe vs Carole,1,"John Cameron Mitchell and Kate McKinnon have a roar with ""Joe vs. Carole,"" but the series offers little of substance.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17893,Joe vs Carole,0,"While Kate McKinnon and John Cameron Mitchell give the title characters some heart in Peacock series, this tired saga should be retired with the Zoom Happy Hours.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17894,Joe vs Carole,0,"Despite some clever writing and decent performances, Joe Vs. Carole can’t really add to the craziness that the real-life Joe Exotic and Carole Baskin showed in Tiger King and all of its offshoots.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17895,Joe vs Carole,0,"Joe vs. Carole is competently made and entertaining enough but having already sat through the first season of Netflix’s bloated Tiger King, Joe vs. Carole can’t help but feel like a rerun of something I already saw.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17896,Joe vs Carole,1,"For all its extravagance and wildness, it may turn out to be more sensitive than the Netflix series.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17897,Joe vs Carole,0,"It's never ideal to arrive way too late to the party, and Joe vs Carole feels guilty of that, adapting the story of Netflix's Tiger King, a.k.a. Joe Exotic, into a limited series that dutifully replicates those events without much bite.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17898,Joe vs Carole,0,"In practice, Joe vs. Carole feels like a brutally over-extended Saturday Night Live sketch, leaning heavily on the jokes we know and expect while clumsily trying to tease out some deeper meaning.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17899,Joe vs Carole,0,It has little purpose than to remind you of the first time you learned about this incredible saga.,Peacock,33%,88%,27
17900,Joe vs Carole,0,You can see why Tiger Kings initial mass popular appeal lead to this drama being pitched  its a lot more difficult to see why anyone thought that appeal might sustain during the time it actually takes to make eight hours of television.,Peacock,33%,88%,27
17901,Joe vs Carole,1,"This might, in fact, be a better telling of the “Tiger King” story than “Tiger King” was, or at least a classier one with clearer morals.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17902,Joe vs Carole,0,"Tiger King’s appeal was its proximity to reality, and the voyeuristic thrill of watching a convoluted and undeniably loopy story. Joe vs Carole merely photocopies it, resulting in something neither illuminating nor emotionally cathartic.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17903,Joe vs Carole,0,"Joe vs. Carole, despite some decent performances and effective directing from Justin Tipping, rarely justifies its existence.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17904,Joe vs Carole,0,"Despite ""untold story"" claims, Joe vs. Carole is dedicated to the already extensively chronicled exploits of Joe Exotic and Carole Baskin.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17905,Joe vs Carole,0,"It’s not that the series isn’t good, though it really isn’t. It’s that with the abundant oversaturation of Tiger King having come and gone, what more can be done?",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17906,Joe vs Carole,1,"If Tiger King was your version of the tale, Joe vs. Carole feels more like your parents' version of the story.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17907,Joe vs Carole,1,"Joe vs. Carole can offer more empathy for its subjects. They may be their own worst enemies when they go in front of cameras, but these actors and filmmakers can see their souls.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17908,Joe vs Carole,1,McKinnon and her co-producers must be credited for conveying the tale in as serious-minded a fashion as possible. In so doing they have achieved something the original Netflix documentary had little interest in attempting.,Peacock,33%,88%,27
17909,Joe vs Carole,0,"Coming out a full two years after the cultural rubbernecking that made Netflix’s Tiger King a brief sensation, the show’s refusal or inability to streamline the themes and narrative of this story has gone from innocuous to grievous.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17910,Joe vs Carole,1,"Just when you think TV has nowhere to go with the antihero, along comes this American original. He’s hard to like, but good luck averting your eyes.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17911,Joe vs Carole,0,"Though it's based on the Wondery podcast that first broke the tawdry tiger tale in 2019, Joe vs. Carole simply doesn't contain enough fresh insight to justify its existence today  despite game performances by the stars.",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17912,Joe vs Carole,1,"It isn't shocking or sensational any more, and it isn't that funny either. Why is it worth your while going over this well-trodden ground once again, and is it even fair to the show's real-life subjects to give them this black comedy treatment?",Peacock,33%,88%,27
17913,The Capture,1,"The Capture is frightening, a little brainy, and damning of those who refuse to recognize deepfakery for the crisis it has become.",Peacock,92%,88%,39
17914,The Capture,1,"Clever military mystery thriller features violence, sex.",Peacock,92%,88%,39
17915,The Capture,1,The Capture shows that such technological leaps of faith come with a downside. The production shows that with great technology comes great responsibility.,Peacock,92%,88%,39
17916,The Capture,1,"This thoughtful but still thrilling series is a worthwhile watch that may leave you a little shaken, wanting to make sure your computer cameras are covered ... just in case.",Peacock,92%,88%,39
17917,The Capture,1,"This is the rare thriller that is not just smart and gripping, but also deeply engaged with our bizarre, often terrifying present. And it's easily the best original show you'll find on Peacock.",Peacock,92%,88%,39
17918,The Capture,1,"The Capture isn't actually anything new, but what it is... is a very well well-crafted take on telling a compelling tale of a former military man condemned by footage of a crime committed on the streets of London.",Peacock,92%,88%,39
17919,The Capture,1,The conspiracy aspects of The Capture are intriguing enough to keep us watching.,Peacock,92%,88%,39
17920,The Capture,1,"A bit convoluted, but for aficionados of British crime drama, reasonably entertaining.",Peacock,92%,88%,39
17921,The Capture,1,"We've seen plenty of this jittery, ""how deep does thing go"" investigation before. But The Capture at least adds a bit of newness in the way it considers a specific kind of technology.",Peacock,92%,88%,39
17922,The Capture,1,"It doesn't necessarily try to copy Bodyguard, but I think has definitely got that Bodyguard-type-vibe. So if you're a fan of that, you'll be a fan of this.",Peacock,92%,88%,39
17923,The Capture,1,A terrifically twisty and intensely suspenseful six-part spy thriller.,Peacock,92%,88%,39
17924,The Capture,1,"The Capture will make you question everything you believe you know to be true, as it gives credence to fake news and media manipulation.",Peacock,92%,88%,39

17926,The Capture,0,"Offers a whiplash-inducing premiere that goes from, ""This is a ridiculous investigation that appears to lack a crime"" to ""How is that possible?""... A somewhat dubious premise.",Peacock,92%,88%,39
17927,The Capture,1,"While the show starts off strong and conjures up twisty cliffhanger endings, it falters in the end due to the convoluted plot. However, with only six episodes, The Capture is just gripping enough to binge in one sitting.",Peacock,92%,88%,39

17929,The Capture,1,"With strong performances and an unabashed willingness to state its points plainly, The Capture suggests solid possibilities for Peacock as a space for shows that are brainier than can thrive on broadcast TV but still retain broadcast's punch and verve.",Peacock,92%,88%,39
17930,The Capture,1,"By turns enthralling and suspenseful, The Capture is the sort of show one could easily binge in an afternoon.",Peacock,92%,88%,39
17931,The Capture,1,Holliday Grainger is great in her turn as a moody detective who is desperate for the truth. But for most people The Capture is the sort of thriller you will be happy to binge watch now and later happy to forget.,Peacock,92%,88%,39
17932,The Capture,1,You will whip through it in a sitting because it's that thrilling but you won't sleep well after watching this because you'll know things.,Peacock,92%,88%,39
17933,The Capture,1,"What starts out looking like a punchy female-driven crime drama in which a cocky young detective stands to learn about being a woman in the ""job"" from her new superior, has shifted into a righteous crusade against conspiracy at the highest level.",Peacock,92%,88%,39
17934,The Capture,1,"In the end, as an intricately woven plot - often thrillingly anchored in the issue of constant surveillance - moves toward its final revelation, you could say it's about powerful people manipulating less powerful people.",Peacock,92%,88%,39

17937,The Capture,1,"The Capture isn't perfect, but it clears a higher bar than most of the genre. And the lead performances are all good enough to steer us through any unevenness. It's well worth a look.",Peacock,92%,88%,39

17942,The Capture,1,"It chugged along and chugged along until the final scenes, which were riveting.",Peacock,92%,88%,39
17943,The Capture,1,So far the first episode has done enough to suggest a decent midweek shaggy-dog story for back-to-school season.,Peacock,92%,88%,39
17944,The Capture,1,"By the end, with wheels within wheels beginning to spin, things are set up nicely.",Peacock,92%,88%,39
17945,The Capture,1,"An intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.",Peacock,92%,88%,39
17946,The Capture,1,[Ben Chanan] taken the best elements of a classic conspiracy thriller and welded them to the urgently topical theme of how video footage is being manipulated to create false narratives and fake news.,Peacock,92%,88%,39
17947,The Capture,1,"The BBC has promoted this as the successor to Bodyguard. It's subtler, slower and much less starry, devoid of suicide bombers and sheets of flame, let alone Keeley Hawes as an oversexed Home Secretary. But it promises to be equally gripping.",Peacock,92%,88%,39
17948,The Capture,1,It's already gripping and I'll tune in next week as Carey searches for the victim.,Peacock,92%,88%,39
17949,The Capture,1,"It is a rather tired idea, thankfully downplayed against the far more exciting backdrop of digital jiggery-pokery and layers of subterfuge, with surveillance teams themselves being surveilled.",Peacock,92%,88%,39
17950,The Capture,1,"The Capture isn't the first drama to make images its primary currency - from Enemy of the State (1998) back to Blow Up (1966), the genre has a distinguished lineage - but it feels like a good time to revisit it",Peacock,92%,88%,39
17951,The Capture,1,"The question of what she has seen is the carrot that dangles before us, pulling us through the rest of an hour that without it would threaten to be very lacklustre indeed.",Peacock,92%,88%,39
17952,Vigil,1,"An exciting, twisty thriller in an unusual setting...",Peacock,85%,72%,20
17953,Vigil,1,This is a visually beautiful series with keen direction by James Strong and Isabelle Sieb.,Peacock,85%,72%,20
17954,Vigil,1,"As much as Vigil captivated British TV audiences with its superb acting and exciting twists, its most important contribution was bringing the submarine out of a 30-year voyage to the depths of cultural irrelevancy.",Peacock,85%,72%,20

17956,Vigil,1,"The character-driven British series combines elements of a police procedural with military high drama to create an intense, suspense-filled viewing experience.",Peacock,85%,72%,20
17957,Vigil,1,The unique setting of Vigil makes it stand out from the many UK-based police procedurals out there. We just hope that the show focuses on the claustrophobia of the sub and doesn't get bogged down in other story elements that might prove to be distracting.,Peacock,85%,72%,20
17958,Vigil,1,One of the better thriller series of the year and one in which a tangled web of intrigues is made as believable as the fathomless ability of humans to complicate a situation -- at least long enough to last a satisfying six episodes.,Peacock,85%,72%,20
17959,Vigil,1,"The confined-space aspect is used to wonderful effect, the characters are engaging and, you know, if you throw in a Russian submarine, too, you've got a killer, six-part thriller.",Peacock,85%,72%,20
17960,Vigil,1,The rhythm is impeccable up until the third episode... but everything works. [Full review in Spanish],Peacock,85%,72%,20
17961,Vigil,0,"The most credible thing that came out of anyone's mouth was Suranne Jones's post-traumatic vomit. Harsh, yes, but as the closing credits rolled I had many questions, chief among them: after six long hours, was that it?",Peacock,85%,72%,20

17966,Vigil,1,"This is, in a nutshell, a straight-down-the-line conspiracy thriller, with the Navy having something to hide, Burke as whistleblower, and Silva as truth-getter. But I never properly bought it... That said, I am still on board.",Peacock,85%,72%,20

17968,Vigil,1,"Vigil comes with a certain uncanny documentary streak, brutal and indubitably chilling.",Peacock,85%,72%,20
17969,Vigil,0,"According to the end credits, Vigil has been made with support from the Scottish government, which makes no secret of its opposition to nuclear weapons. That may hint at an extra political edge, but doesn't make this a compelling drama.",Peacock,85%,72%,20
17970,Vigil,1,A taut mystery with intriguingly murky depths. Sunday nights are stressful again -- I wouldn't have it any other way.,Peacock,85%,72%,20
17971,Vigil,1,Vigil has everything it needs.,Peacock,85%,72%,20

17974,Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,"It quickly plummets into your bog-standard, formulaic Dan Brown storyline in which Langdon is a helpless prisoner of a contrived, all-constraining plot.",Peacock,57%,53%,14
17975,Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,There's nothing Ashley Zukerman could have done to make Robert Landgon less of a butthead; his insufferability is a problem with the writing of the show.,Peacock,57%,53%,14
17976,Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,"""The Lost Symbol"" feels like something you'd watch on Saturday morning cable when the remote is lost, though Peacock might be hoping to secure fans of the ""Librarians"" franchise, too.",Peacock,57%,53%,14
17977,Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,1,"This type of storytelling, where much of the emphasis has to be placed on worldbuilding and exposition, might not scratch the itch for fans of the genre.",Peacock,57%,53%,14
17978,Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,1,"Throughout these first three episodes, they feed the audience just enough bits of information to get us all hooked and coming back for more. In that regard, it plays just like Brown's adventure stories.",Peacock,57%,53%,14
17979,Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,1,It certainly seems like it'll have a lot of action and adventure and not burden the audience with a ton of backstory. We just hope the show doesn't get repetitive.,Peacock,57%,53%,14
17980,Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,1,"Of course it's wacky and completely unrealistic, but considering it's basically an adult Carmen SanDiego CD-ROM game, that is exactly the appeal.",Peacock,57%,53%,14
17981,Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,"Viewers who can suspend their disbelief about that setup may be able to enjoy this conspiracy thriller that feels, frustratingly, like a wild goose chase.",Peacock,57%,53%,14
17982,Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,1,"If The Lost Symbol plays it right, the series will capture the same delight that the books did, as we tag along with Langdon as he solves this mystery. ""As Above, So Below"" sets the series off on the right track.",Peacock,57%,53%,14
17983,Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,"Ashley Zukerman's Robert Langdon is an acceptable ""everyman"" hero with twinges of academic arrogance and situational awkwardness, but the overall mystery feels derivative and dopey.",Peacock,57%,53%,14
17984,Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,"You have a show of very handsomely designed interiors - museums, galleries, Masonic temples and whatnot - and then actors squinting and explaining. No matter how outlandish the topic of the discussions, there isn't enough oxygen in the room to sustain.",Peacock,57%,53%,14
17985,Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,1,All of the building blocks are here but there is just something missing. Fans of the books may find this adaptation to be a far more satisfying take on the source material but it still fails to be a rollicking adventure.,Peacock,57%,53%,14
17986,Parenthood,1,The writers opted to take most story lines where fans hoped they would go.,Peacock,88%,95%,19

17989,Parenthood,1,"The Bravermans left their mark on us in a way not many families do -- especially on TV -- and for that we'll be forever grateful, even through our tearful goodbye.",Peacock,88%,95%,19
17990,Parenthood,1,This was a standout show that produced a standout finale.,Peacock,88%,95%,19
17991,Parenthood,1,"Like any family drama, Parenthood tells an old story, but it's done it with thoughtful attention to a central question: What is a family for? What is a parent's job?",Peacock,88%,95%,19
17992,Parenthood,1,"The show's creators have stealthily, quietly carved out a cast of characters who defy gender clichés, on both sides.",Peacock,88%,95%,19
17993,Parenthood,1,"It's been the most sincere program on television, often mocked for its many scenes ending in tears, but never relenting in its goal to present parenthood as a difficult yet ultimately rewarding adventure.",Peacock,88%,95%,19
17994,Parenthood,1,"In other words: if you didn't cry this week, not to worry. Jason Katims and co. were just building. And if they continue to do that properly, the tears will come.",Peacock,88%,95%,19
17995,Parenthood,1,"Because Howard and longtime producing partner Brian Grazer are at the helm, Parenthood seems to be getting the care and feeding it deserves -- and the cast is peppered with proven performers who can deliver the goods.",Peacock,88%,95%,19
17996,Parenthood,1,"""Parenthood"" was so lovable that everything it did wrong felt like an exasperating yet predictable outrage -- in other words, it felt like family.",Peacock,88%,95%,19
17997,Parenthood,1,Parenthood is one of the most frustrating shows I've ever loved.,Peacock,88%,95%,19
17998,Parenthood,1,"The beauty of the Bravermans is that over the course of six seasons, they came to feel like our family, too. It's only natural to want what's best for your family. And we got it.",Peacock,88%,95%,19
17999,Parenthood,1,"The parents of Parenthood, who include old-school TV guy Ron Howard, can be proud of how the kid turned out.",Peacock,88%,95%,19
18000,Parenthood,1,"It's this aspect of this show, the unwaveringly honesty depiction of family life, whether triumphant or tragic, that makes Parenthood so relatable to so many.",Peacock,88%,95%,19
18001,Parenthood,1,"The first hour of Parenthood's final season found the Braverman clan dealing with a number of thoroughly grown-up changes, all of them eliciting reactions ranging from, ""How could she?!"" to ""Can someone pass the Kleenex?""",Peacock,88%,95%,19
18002,Parenthood,1,"Last night's premiere may not have been the typical tear jerker episode of Parenthood, but I did get a little weepy.",Peacock,88%,95%,19
18003,Parenthood,1,I hope we'll continue to have more great father/son moments with Zeek and Crosby. Their relationship is my favorite.,Peacock,88%,95%,19

18005,We Are Lady Parts,1,"Stories about outsiders are inherently powerful, because the odds are stacked up against the characters. The leads of this British comedy-drama are a triple minority: they are women, they are Muslim, and they are first-generation immigrants.",Peacock,100%,80%,45
18006,We Are Lady Parts,1,"Short, pithy and outrageously funny.",Peacock,100%,80%,45
18007,We Are Lady Parts,1,"A bonafide smash hit. Centered around five Muslim women from various MENA backgrounds, We Are Lady Parts gives us nuanced, complex depictions of Muslim women that we've never seen on American television before.",Peacock,100%,80%,45
18008,We Are Lady Parts,1,"In addition to winning performances, a genuinely exciting soundtrack, and brilliant bits of silliness in each episode, this penchant for failure is what uplifts We Are Lady Parts to a young queer audience's must-watch.",Peacock,100%,80%,45
18009,We Are Lady Parts,1,"We Are Lady Parts is a lot of things: exhilarating, witty, funny, scabrous, pointed, punk, sadly relevant and absolutely necessary. It's entertaining as hell, with a lively cast and a vivid, cinematic style.",Peacock,100%,80%,45
18010,We Are Lady Parts,1,It's an exuberant music comedy that sees Nida drawing on her own experiences and taking inspiration from the cultural artists that reside in London. It is unapologetically bold and a joyful celebration of the richness and diversity found in this city.,Peacock,100%,80%,45
18011,We Are Lady Parts,1,"Full of smash-cuts and rapid-fire dialogue, the six-episode series is subversive and confident and almost merrily rowdy in spirit.",Peacock,100%,80%,45

18022,We Are Lady Parts,1,"It accomplishes more than so many fatter series -- a full story arc, a sense of cultural depth, a strong female gaze, a group of winning songs -- in only three-or-so hours. The six half-hour episodes are a triumph of reach and representation.",Peacock,100%,80%,45

18025,We Are Lady Parts,1,We Are Lady Parts is an absolute delight with my only complaint against it being that there's just a single short season available on streaming.,Peacock,100%,80%,45

18030,We Are Lady Parts,1,"American TV and film has never been as bold, or as thorough, in its depiction of Muslim women as Manzoor's half-hour comedy.",Peacock,100%,80%,45
18031,We Are Lady Parts,1,"There is a lot to love about We Are Lady Parts. The dialogue is sharp and funny. Vasan's performance is endearingly vulnerable... Like KISS and VU before them, Lady Parts are here to rock.",Peacock,100%,80%,45
18032,We Are Lady Parts,1,"I mean, lady parts? Sheer balls, if you ask me. I haven't seen anything like this on British television before.",Peacock,100%,80%,45
18033,We Are Lady Parts,1,"You never get the impression that Manzoor is trying to make a grand statement. Yet through her writing and direction, and the impressive performances, she does just that. ""We Are Lady Parts"" is meaningful. It's also a lot of fun",Peacock,100%,80%,45
18034,We Are Lady Parts,1,"For a show with such a radical premise, We Are Lady Parts is effectively Modern Sitcom 101.",Peacock,100%,80%,45

18061,MacGruber,1,"The cast - Forte and Wiig, in particular - completely commit themselves to the absurdity of it, and therein lies the remaining joy of MacGruber: Watching great comedic actors abandon their dignity in service of a laugh.",Peacock,85%,76%,20

18066,MacGruber,1,"The action may be bigger, and the jokes slightly more ridiculous, but that's to be expected in MacGruber's biggest story yet.",Peacock,85%,76%,20
18067,MacGruber,1,Couldn't be more faithful to the character. [Full review in Spanish],Peacock,85%,76%,20
18068,MacGruber,1,"The jump to an episodic format isn't always kind to MacGruber, which doesn't have quite enough plot to fill out its eight episodes, but even when the writing starts to go astray, the cast's commitment to this wacky premise smooths over the rough edges.",Peacock,85%,76%,20
18069,MacGruber,1,"Just in time for the holidays, get ready for a throat-ripping good time with what will hopefully be the first of many seasons of MacGruber.",Peacock,85%,76%,20
18070,MacGruber,1,"It's almost impossible to describe a big chunk of what makes MacGruber enjoyable without just listing off a string of jokes that Forte, Wiig, and a handful of other lucky guest stars get to toss in the mix.",Peacock,85%,76%,20
18071,MacGruber,1,[MacGruber] is about as stupidly funny as you would hope.,Peacock,85%,76%,20
18072,MacGruber,1,"It's Kristen Wiig as Vicki St. Elmo who steals the show, digging deep into her bag of tone-deaf accents and silly love songs.",Peacock,85%,76%,20
18073,MacGruber,1,"Because Will Forte and the rest of the cast commit to making MacGruber as serious as possible, it makes a silly show actually pretty funny.",Peacock,85%,76%,20
18074,MacGruber,0,"An unnecessary reminder that not everything that's funny for three minutes works for two hours, much less four.",Peacock,85%,76%,20
18075,MacGruber,1,"It may tax the patience of some viewers at my tier of fandom, but the fiercest of devotees will doubtlessly find MacGruber to be the MacGruberiest TV show of the year.",Peacock,85%,76%,20
18076,MacGruber,1,"MacGruber on Peacock, for all its flaws, has the same batting average the character has always had. He is, for good and for ill, the same at any length.",Peacock,85%,76%,20
18077,MacGruber,1,"MacGruber seems intended for a narrow audience whom this reviewer is not among, but the sheer vim that went into stretching a one-joke premise into an expansive riff on the action serial is hard to deny.",Peacock,85%,76%,20
18078,MacGruber,1,This series takes everything you love about the film and expands upon it. It's like getting two or three MacGruber sequels at once.,Peacock,85%,76%,20
18079,Unsolved Mysteries,1,"The other stories featured in Unsolved Mysteries do, of course, pander to a morbid interest we have in true crime, but Tsunami Spirits brings us back to reality and reminds us of those affected in these cases.",Peacock,77%,69%,5
18080,Unsolved Mysteries,1,"These reports are wild but have evidence to back them up, which makes them even more entrancing - especially as they are set against the background of Japanese culture and the way it honors those who have passed.",Peacock,77%,69%,5
18081,Unsolved Mysteries,1,"With every episode opening with its classic eerie theme song intact, ""Unsolved Mysteries"" still has the ability to be endlessly fascinating.",Peacock,77%,69%,5
18082,Unsolved Mysteries,0,Unsolved Mysteries is likely to stay but it has to do better to become a staple series on the streaming service.,Peacock,77%,69%,5
18083,Unsolved Mysteries,1,Volume two picks up where the last one left off. The Netflix revival is still a globe spanning series with some interesting stories.,Peacock,77%,69%,5
18084,Departure,1,"The second season is still well-plotted and satisfyingly mysterious as long as you're new to all this. On the other hand, the first season is better written and has Plummer.",Peacock,80%,42%,2
18085,Departure,0,"Departure Season 2 is, unfortunately, an over-complicated mess that loses sight of what made Departure Season 1 so wonderful.",Peacock,80%,42%,2
18086,American Auto,1,"A mad satire of corporate life, it is mainly set in the boardroom, where executives prove daily that they know nothing. It's got the contemporary, socially aware vibe of Superstore and has the same creative team.",Peacock,100%,51%,11
18087,American Auto,1,"It's smart and very funny after only three episodes, so if it gets an opportunity at a second season, I can only see it getting better.",Peacock,100%,51%,11

18089,American Auto,1,"This offbeat, albeit formulaic series features an ensemble cast of semi-competent employees negotiating workplace issues while trying to keep their inept company afloat.",Peacock,100%,51%,11
18090,American Auto,1,There's enough promise to American Auto to keep us watching when it starts its regular timeslot in January. But the show really needs to get beyond workplace comedy archetypes if it's really going to shine.,Peacock,100%,51%,11
18091,American Auto,1,"[A] smart, promising show.",Peacock,100%,51%,11
18092,American Auto,1,"Like Gasteyer, the rest of American Auto's cast is uniformly hilarious. But the laughs come zooming out of all directions on American Auto.",Peacock,100%,51%,11
18093,American Auto,1,Can't help but feel like an unofficial companion piece to Spitzer's Superstore - but from the other end of the corporate hierarchy.,Peacock,100%,51%,11
18094,American Auto,1,"While ""American Auto"" feels like it's having some early engine trouble, it's worth taking this new ride into the shop for a tune-up.",Peacock,100%,51%,11
18095,American Auto,1,"The ensemble is strong -- White and Dyer are appealing, and Michael B. Washington's measured delivery is always a treat. And if the show's attempts to exhibit real edge may make viewers cringe, Gasteyer provides a strong reason to keep watching.",Peacock,100%,51%,11
18096,American Auto,1,"Funny and fast-paced, this single-camera comedy is worth a test drive.",Peacock,100%,51%,11

18100,Warehouse 13,1,"It's a sci-fi/fantasy ""who's who"" as Warehouse 13 pulls out all the stops in a time-tripping free-for-all that opens the condensed fifth and final season on a boisterous note.",Peacock,82%,89%,7
18101,Warehouse 13,1,"Like all good installments of Warehouse 13, it is the smaller moments that make the show so much fun. Pete's constant need for a snack and thinking about food are still out in force, and the banter between Steve and Claudia is even more sarcastic.",Peacock,82%,89%,7
18102,Warehouse 13,1,It didn't take long for both storylines to get up and running on Monday.,Peacock,82%,89%,7

18106,Save Me,1,"Learning lessons and wisely evolving from its stylistic first series, Save Me Too is a successful sequel to what was already an obsessive mystery.",Peacock,100%,96%,15
18107,Save Me,1,"All the things I found outstanding about most of the last series: realism, naturalistic dialogue, attention to detail and confident silences.",Peacock,100%,96%,15
18108,Save Me,1,"The subject matter is distressing but never gratuitous. The focus is on the parents grieving for a lost daughter, and what to do with that grief when the news cycle and the police have moved on.",Peacock,100%,96%,15
18109,Save Me,1,"This is shaping up to be another quality instalment, and I admire James's reluctance to take the easiest path. This does mean that the question of whether anyone will find Jody, though, remains as open as ever.",Peacock,100%,96%,15
18110,Save Me,1,"Save Me Too digs deeper and takes even those familiar with series one on a journey they won't be expecting - satisfying yet surprising, it's sure to have its loyal audience hooked all over again.",Peacock,100%,96%,15
18111,Save Me,1,Far more nuanced and character-driven than many other entries in the genre.,Peacock,100%,96%,15
18112,Save Me,1,"James' triumph here is to create a cast of characters who are not great human beings, but who are believable and empathetic. The twists and turns of the narrative are completely gripping, but it is as a study in human frailty that Save Me really shines.",Peacock,100%,96%,15
18113,Save Me,1,"The performances are all superb. James is extraordinary, a tour de force, while Suranne Jones, as Jody's anguished mother, is heartbreakingly believable.",Peacock,100%,96%,15
18114,Save Me,1,"It is, if anything, better than the original, charting the toxins spread throughout an entire community via just one tiny group's sociopathic sense of sexual entitlement, and thus the disjointed distrusts that must fester and breed.",Peacock,100%,96%,15
18115,Save Me,1,"Once again, [Lennie] James is electrifying as Nelly.",Peacock,100%,96%,15
18116,Save Me,1,"This series builds to some stunning places, with real tension and surprises. It's a drama foremost, but one that happens to play all the right thriller notes, though not necessarily in the ""right"" order. The result is something original and captivating.",Peacock,100%,96%,15
18117,Save Me,1,"It's funny, clever, sometimes melancholy and often beautifully unsettling.",Peacock,100%,96%,15
18118,Save Me,1,Save Me doesn't have to make big statements; it can just watch people be people.,Peacock,100%,96%,15
18119,Project Blue Book,1,Whether this is enough to attract new viewers remains to be seen but fans should be satisfied with where the show is heading. If the showrunners could just decide whether they preferred fact or fiction they could really be on to something.,Peacock,67%,91%,2
18120,Project Blue Book,1,[I]t's as good as ever.,Peacock,67%,91%,2
18121,Saved by the Bell,1,"A show that should be only nostalgia  and I wont deny theres a big helping of that  ends up being a lot more, thanks to a combination of good, smart writing, talented actors and a lot of chemistry between the cast.",Peacock,88%,71%,6
18122,Saved by the Bell,1,"Saved by the Bell Season 2 continues to offer a story that has real substance and heart, all while poking fun of its former self in the best of ways.",Peacock,88%,71%,6
18123,Saved by the Bell,1,Season two of Saved by the Bell is sharper and more astute than the previous season.,Peacock,88%,71%,6
18124,Saved by the Bell,1,"Like season one, the second ten-episode installment makes for a rewarding, if breezy, bit of binge watching for longtime fans, while also giving space for the new characters to make their own mark.",Peacock,88%,71%,6
18125,Saved by the Bell,1,Television reboots trade off the public's long-running familiarity with their stars; kudos to this one for allowing Berkley Lauren the chance to turn the page.,Peacock,88%,71%,6
18126,Saved by the Bell,1,"It's... very, very funny, and in the second season proves even more willing to embrace its bizarre universe.",Peacock,88%,71%,6
18127,The Bletchley Circle,0,"Instead of stroking suspense, the show starts and stops in fits, never finding a thrilling stride that unites the mysteries and deepens characterizations. Let's hope that Anna isn't on a permanent vacation.",Peacock,85%,93%,7
18128,The Bletchley Circle,1,"The mysteries [the characters] take on are often related to a personal relationship for at least one of the women, and in turn, it heightens the tension and the stakes for them all.",Peacock,85%,93%,7
18129,The Bletchley Circle,1,"This unassuming show finds a way to turn many of its limitations into virtues, and it's not hard to end up thinking of the Bletchley women as very British badasses.",Peacock,85%,93%,7
18130,The Bletchley Circle,1,"Though The Bletchley Circle is a mystery series, it's not a show to be watched for the riddles-at least, this season isn't. Instead, this is a season about re-examining the past with a feminine perspective.",Peacock,85%,93%,7

18135,The Defiant Ones,1,"The Defiant Ones is witty, polished, grand in scale, ambition and budget, while remaining totally engrossing. The other music docs may as well give up now.",Peacock,100%,91%,24

18137,The Defiant Ones,1,"While it might have made more sense to profile Iovine and Dre's lives separately, the basic device of telling them concurrently works, and Episode One holds your attention throughout.",Peacock,100%,91%,24
18138,The Defiant Ones,1,"The Defiant Ones works on almost every level: as a primer on the music industry, as gossip, as biography, as a time capsule of the 1980s, the 1990s, and the beginning of the 21st century.",Peacock,100%,91%,24
18139,The Defiant Ones,1,"Men have flaws, and for these two icons, the ultimate act of defiance might be showing them.",Peacock,100%,91%,24
18140,The Defiant Ones,1,"The Defiant Ones succeeds because it realizes that while Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre might be a billionaire boy's club now, the divergent histories of these men track the relatively early days of rock and roll and rap",Peacock,100%,91%,24
18141,The Defiant Ones,1,"The Defiant Ones remains essential viewing for any fan of popular music. It shows the power of friendship, partnership and the relentless quest to be the best.",Peacock,100%,91%,24

18145,The Defiant Ones,1,"The Defiant Ones is nothing if not entertaining, shot slick and edited sharp; it's no chore for anyone seeking a chaperoned visitor's pass to music history.",Peacock,100%,91%,24
18146,The Defiant Ones,1,"Mature, insightful docu about unlikely hip-hop partnership.",Peacock,100%,91%,24
18147,The Defiant Ones,1,"Music fans looking for a stylishly made documentary that celebrates two influential record producers, and overflows with rock, hip hop, and pop superstars, should find The Defiant Ones breezy summer viewing.",Peacock,100%,91%,24
18148,The Defiant Ones,1,"The Defiant Ones tells a compelling story and tells it effectively and well, but its bloated length is a bit hard to justify.",Peacock,100%,91%,24
18149,The Defiant Ones,1,"The Defiant Ones harbors an obvious soft spot for these big personalities, but ultimately provides an enlightening window into Iovine and Dre in particular and the big business of the music industry in general.",Peacock,100%,91%,24
18150,The Defiant Ones,1,"The Defiant Ones is an absorbing look at two men -- one white and raised in Brooklyn, the other black and straight outta Compton -- who overcame a lot and have accomplished a great deal.",Peacock,100%,91%,24
18151,The Defiant Ones,1,The Defiant Ones does spend a little too much time praising and mythologizing its subjects. But it's also a comprehensive look at Dre's and Iovine's history.,Peacock,100%,91%,24
18152,The Defiant Ones,1,Where The Defiant Ones really soars however -- and where it can teach all of us a lesson -- is by capturing what happens when we open our minds and ears to one another.,Peacock,100%,91%,24
18153,The Defiant Ones,1,"Hughes tries to weave in a number of larger stories besides Dre's and Iovine's own tales. So besides the personal bios, the four-part series also attempts to explore the dramatic changes in the music industry over the period.",Peacock,100%,91%,24

18159,Obi-Wan Kenobi,1,Genre stories like Obi-Wan Kenobi are today’s dominant fictional narratives. It’s not a slight to subject them to impassioned analysis or critical inquiry; it’s a sign of respect.,Disney+,83%,63%,2
18160,Ms. Marvel,1,Ms. Marvel feels like the first Disney+ show to really focus on the “origin” part of the origin story and get it right.,Disney+,98%,82%,6
18161,Ms. Marvel,1,"The marriage of Islamic customs with South Asian cultural heritage – the music, the clothes, the dancing – is all the more remarkable in how it illustrates that Muslim lives are nowhere as uniform as western film and TV habitually makes them out to be.",Disney+,98%,82%,6
18162,Ms. Marvel,1,"Sensational stuff, a comic book dream & a brilliant message of tolerance/trust of our fellow world beings. It always seems to be art that makes the statements that we need to be better toward one another, and MS. MARVEL is leading the way. Shazam! Oops.",Disney+,98%,82%,6
18163,Ms. Marvel,1,Deepening this tale about a teen desperate to follow her heart — a story that's hardly unique — is how wonderfully culturally specific Ms Marvel proves.,Disney+,98%,82%,6

18165,Ms. Marvel,1,"Ms. Marvel doesn't reinvent the superhero wheel. Instead, it dips it in gold and bedazzles it with eye-melting visuals.",Disney+,98%,82%,6
18166,Moon Knight,0,This hodgepodge of underdeveloped themes is augmented by run-of-the-mill action sequences that not only lack invention but also emotional thrust. Mohamed Diab’s first foray into Hollywood is a giant folly with a lot of promise and too little reward.,Disney+,86%,91%,121
18167,Moon Knight,1,The first MCU Disney+ series that doesn't feel like homework.,Disney+,86%,91%,121
18168,Moon Knight,0,"While certainly Oscar Issacs, as well as the emotional and accurate depiction of DID, manage to spice the series up a tiny bit, Moon Knight ultimately proves too adherent to the MCU's storytelling checkboxes to feel worthwhile.",Disney+,86%,91%,121
18169,Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is a fun six part story, though some early and mid episodes are a little lacking it soon picks up, and even then those episodes are often full of great acting from Oscar Isaac as the duel personalities of our “hero”. Wouldn’t say no to more!",Disney+,86%,91%,121

18173,Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight has turned out to be one of the better Marvel series, mostly because it feels different. The show is supposedly set in the same universe as the Avengers, but viewers can enjoy it as a stand-alone series.",Disney+,86%,91%,121
18174,Moon Knight,0,A series that ultimately feels rushed.,Disney+,86%,91%,121

18179,Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight's penultimate episode is, undoubtedly, its best yet. Oscar Isaac is a tour de force, churning in top-tier performances as both Marc Spector and Steven Grant.",Disney+,86%,91%,121
18180,Moon Knight,1,"It establishes the Marvel miniseries not just as add-ons that wrap up stories from already-established names and faces, but rather as a tool that can stand on its own as a functional, exciting, and informative piece in the larger Marvel story.",Disney+,86%,91%,121

18184,Moon Knight,1,"Marvel nerds are sure to be talking about this one, but it seems likely that a broader audience will get sucked into the Moon Knight story world too.",Disney+,86%,91%,121
18185,Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is slow, and ponderous, and only strange in fits and starts, at least until the back half of the series when it commits to the surrealism inherent in its premise.",Disney+,86%,91%,121
18186,Moon Knight,1,"There's enough intrigue established to inspire curiosity about just how it's all going to play out, in the end, and Isaacs's performance alone is enough to recommend it.",Disney+,86%,91%,121
18187,Moon Knight,1,Moon Knight is a seductively dark series that manages to be both eerie and shadowy and full of hijinks.,Disney+,86%,91%,121
18188,Moon Knight,1,I didn't know what was going on half the time but I still kind of liked it.,Disney+,86%,91%,121
18189,Moon Knight,1,"Due to the deeper mythology and the diversity of the characters, theres a lot to enjoy. It feels respectful, instead of a cultural grab for the sake of something different.",Disney+,86%,91%,121
18190,Moon Knight,0,"The rickety action sequences, paired with questionable CGI, drippy horror, terrible jokes, a shoddily assembled mystery and one too many rounds of over-the-top violence combine to make Moon Knight an unfortunate dud on the Marvel roster.",Disney+,86%,91%,121
18191,Moon Knight,1,"I cared more about this very scared and beautiful man, this bumbling idiot, than I have cared about any Marvel character for a long time.",Disney+,86%,91%,121
18192,Moon Knight,1,Moon Knight's opening episode makes it clear that this series cares about showing the aftermath of otherworldly power and the destruction it brings to humanity.,Disney+,86%,91%,121
18193,Moon Knight,1,"it just gets better and better. Oscar Isaac gives one of the funnest, if not one of the best turns of his career",Disney+,86%,91%,121
18194,Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight combines the ancient mythology of the Thor films with the campy tomb-hunting of the Mummy franchise, resulting a series that's often fun but with a bit of a muddled tone.",Disney+,86%,91%,121
18195,Moon Knight,0,"Moon Knight, literally and figuratively, has dissociative identity disorder -- in the battle for coherent narrative, at least, and infrequently summoning the suit just doesn't cut through all that clutter.",Disney+,86%,91%,121
18196,Moon Knight,1,"Marvel Studios is taking a gamble with Moon Knight as the series is not nearly as family friendly as their other series. Its certainly a darker, scarier, and more intellectually probing piece for Marvel",Disney+,86%,91%,121

18199,Moon Knight,1,"Coming off a comedic, fan-service-driven entry like No Way Home seems like the perfect time to go in the opposite direction... Peppering in horror would be a great way to do that, and Moon Knight is a small but satisfying step in that direction.",Disney+,86%,91%,121

18339,Loki,1,"A second season was announced just prior to the season finale, which did set up a good old cliffhanger of an ending. But right now, the biggest things in the MCU are happening on the small screen, and I'm here for it.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18340,Loki,1,"Loki's first season was a triumph, full of great performances, effects and lots of amusing timeline shenanigans plus a great finale that sets up so much to come in the MCU.",Disney+,92%,91%,130

18342,Loki,0,"Can't have a Multiverse of Madness without introducing the multiverse first, right?",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18343,Loki,1,It's like Marvel meets Brazil and I'm here for it.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18344,Loki,1,"The centrality of the romance in Loki makes it stand out within the MCU-and signals how much potential there is in this kind of storytelling, should Marvel choose to mine it.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18345,Loki,1,One of the smartest decisions Marvel ever made was realizing that Thor was absurd and ought to be a comedy.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18346,Loki,1,"The show delivers on its promise, on fans' expectations, and on its links to the grander MCU canvas.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18347,Loki,1,"The jury is out on Thor's adopted brother, but one thing is for sure- the show about him is so far, very, very good.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18348,Loki,1,"Thanks to its retro-futuristic Mad Men meets Blade Runner vibe [...] and Natalie Holt's theremin-led background score that was wholly distinct from Marvel fare, Loki carved out an identity for itself.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18349,Loki,1,The opening arc of Marvel's latest small-screen adventure doesn't disappoint.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18350,Loki,1,"Right now, the rest of the supporting cast struggles to keep up with them, and there are a million ways its time-travel whodunit plot can go south. But based on what we've seen so far, Loki has the chance to be the best Marvel series yet.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18351,Loki,1,"At least through the first two episodes, it manages to hold its own from a narrative standpoint, deftly blending humor and action with the occasional twist.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18352,Loki,1,[Loki is] shaping up to be one of the weirder and thus more interesting Marvel offerings.,Disney+,92%,91%,130

18354,Loki,1,"Clever, bold and flat out fascinating, ""Loki"" sets a new bar for Disney+ shows.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18355,Loki,1,This one's going to be good.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18356,Loki,1,An action-packed and surprisingly emotional middle chapter for Loki that does a great job reminding us why we're tuning in.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18357,Loki,1,Definitely another must watch show.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18358,Loki,1,Hiddleston & Wilson continuously steal the show with their chemistry and hilarious banter. Nice to see some new strong female leads in the MCU as well.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18359,Loki,1,"... the stage is set in Loki for an abnormal (in a good way) journey, analyzing the heck out of the Loki character and all his flaws, while adding in new characters that we will either love or hate. Mischief is all but a guarantee.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18360,Loki,1,"This all might be merely preposterous, but life has been breathed into it by the central double act of Hiddleston and Owen Wilson.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18361,Loki,1,"Aside from the acting, this is another Marvel masterclass in design.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18362,Loki,1,"And as long as Hiddleston and Wilson keep at it, ""Loki"" is worth watching, despite its shortcomings.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18363,Loki,1,Hiddleston's performance as Loki has always been defined by its humour as much as its pathos. Both seem to be on display in equal measure in Loki.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18364,Loki,1,"Wilson, now at the peak of his powers, is a real hoot. He's effortlessly perfect as the grizzled old detective type, but he's also deadpan comedy gold, and watching him and Hiddleston play off each other is an unexpected delight.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18365,Loki,1,"WandaVision and the Falcon and the Winter Soldier set the standards as high as Asgard, Loki and his cheeky little persona has come along to raise that bar even higher with yet another fresh and original start that see's him toying with his own conscience.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18366,Loki,1,"Intriguing comedic/fantasy sci-fi series, featuring conniving Loki, the Norse God of Mischief.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18367,Loki,1,"There is a clear balance on the normal and exaggeration (Hiddleston feels very comfortable handling that tone), but Loki is not a completely surprising and successful series for now. [Full Review in Spanish]",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18368,Loki,1,"Because Loki is the most fun MCU character, the potential here is Marvel-ous. Lotsa complex exposition at the top but the potential for comic-licous atmosphere is apparent.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18369,Loki,1,I've seen the first two episodes so far and Loki should please Marvel fans. Tom Hiddleston is in prime form as our title character.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18370,Loki,1,"It kept the punchiness and the fun and the cool nature of Marvel, and it also opens up the universe to incredible potential and seeds the later stories.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18371,Loki,1,"Loki [has] an offbeat, fun, scenario that fits rather well with star Tom Hiddleston's ability to make such a sly and occasionally morally repugnant character so ingratiating.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18372,Loki,1,"Loki will hit the spot for Marvel fans waiting for the next batch of theatrical releases, but it's also not stale and proves that being a franchise doesn't have to mean limiting real creativity.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18373,Loki,1,"Hiddleston is in full show-off mode yet again, effortlessly swinging between grandiose egomaniac and scared little boy with the intelligent comic timing that made us fall in love with him the very first time he donned the horns.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18374,Loki,1,"The great thing about it is that the Marvel comic book universe is endless and unstoppable, and ancient rules seem carved in stone, but things can change on a dime; that's a huge part of the fun.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18375,Loki,1,The new Marvel series combines the inventiveness of WandaVision with the buddy-comedy repartee missing from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18376,Loki,1,"With LOKI, the MCU seems to be going for THE ODD COUPLE by way of ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND...as much character study as a dissertation on society. It's hardly kids' stuff.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18377,Loki,1,"The new MCU series is a time traveling crime thriller. The first two episodes are heavy on the exposition between Owen Wilson and Tom Hiddleston, and light on the action but it is full of intrigue with a set up that'll keep viewers tuned in.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18378,Loki,1,The first episode was a wild ride of its own and I can't wait to see where Waldron and Herron will take us in the coming weeks. WATCH THIS NOW.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18379,Loki,1,There is enough spark in the beginning to inspire us to take time with the God of Mischief.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18380,Loki,1,"The blessing of Loki is that there's no reason to believe Mobius is actually right. He may not even believe what he's saying. As a way to manipulate a master manipulator, telling Loki he's incapable of change or success is a brilliant stroke.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18381,Loki,1,"The show's creator, Michael Waldron, and director, Kate Herron, have laid out a rather elegant framework for their plans.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18382,Loki,1,"The overall vibe of Loki is, like WandaVision, more off the beaten Marvel path. Both the MCU as a whole and this individual series are the better for it.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18383,Loki,1,"This delightful, thoughtful addition to the MCU brings all the quirky fun and humor of Thor: Ragnarok while deftly exploring some pretty big questions about existence and free will.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18384,Loki,1,"[Loki] exists almost expressly as fan service, offering its elbow to safely walk us across this bridge in the franchise. It's a handsome escort, certainly. But I do wonder how long it can hold up its end of a deeper conversation.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18385,Loki,1,"Loki, in drawing inspiration not from the established MCU method but from the looser narratives of comic books, feels like a refreshing reset for the franchise.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18386,Loki,1,"The heavy influences don't weigh down the narrative but unexpectedly gives the comic genre a refreshing, although borrowed, prefab architectural playground to play on, especially when things take an Escher-ial turn.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18387,Loki,1,"Plenty to love in this series so far, it's delightfully kooky which helps averts the superhero fatigue. Tom Hiddleston relishes in being an anti-hero, and this series gives him a chance to show the many sides of Loki in such a fun way.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18388,Loki,1,"Looks like it's going to be a fun show, whether you're an MCU fanatic or not.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18389,Loki,1,The MCU is back and Loki is another excellent addition to the Disney Plus roster.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18390,Loki,0,"Loki feels too constrained, too stale, for a story about a wayward god of mischief. Too much exposition bogs down the script.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18391,Loki,0,"The series achieves its ultimate manifestation as Saturday-afternoon animation. With Loki, Marvel, Disney, and their die-hard constituents have found ways to make the banal even more banal.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18392,Loki,1,"Loki is a fun, weird, occasionally awkward shift away from the Marvel cinematic aesthetic that gives one of its central and most popular players room to be both exactly what we expect him to be and also the space to be something more than we've seen.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18393,Loki,1,"Like the big-screen Avengers movies before it, Loki is the perfect distillation of everything Marvel has been working toward -- just slightly smaller and less godlike. Sort of like Loki.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18394,Loki,0,"The idea of Loki bouncing around history and stirring up trouble is more than enough ammo for a series, but Loki makes the bizarre choice of bogging itself down under layers and layers of bureaucracy.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18395,Loki,1,"If Loki leans more enthusiastically into the time-hopping adventure aspect, as it surely must, I'm sure viewers will begin to have almost as good a time as Hiddleston and Wilson clearly are.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18396,Loki,1,"Let's hope that the balance between talk and action improves, and that Waldron finds more to do for Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Wunmi Mosaku, who have so far been wasted as a TVA judge and hunter respectively.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18397,Loki,1,"The first two episodes involve Mobius convincing Loki to pitch in - giving Wilson and star Tom Hiddleston time to develop a quirky, cantankerous chemistry a la Men in Black's Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18398,Loki,1,"The fan-favorite gets to be the protagonist -you could argue he already did it in all of the Thor movies. The show is part workplace buddy comedy, part time-travel adventure and part procedural crime investigation, with a side of Marvel superhero panache.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18399,Loki,1,"Tom Hiddleston has always been reasonably magnetic as Loki, but he has nothing on Wilson's incredible charismatic chill.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18400,Loki,1,"If anything, it's a little too easy, and as the star rather than a supporting player, Hiddleston can sometimes appear to be coasting through the so-so material.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18401,Loki,1,"Tom Hiddleston comfortable in the skin of the Asgardian but not allowing overconfidence, achieving that difficult mix between Machiavellian and charismatic, managing to feel both familiar and different simultaneously. [Full review in Spanish]",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18402,Loki,1,Tom Hiddleston feels like the perfect guide to lead us through some wild and wacky adventures.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18403,Loki,1,"The real hook of Loki, however, is the god of mischief's interplay with co-star Owen Wilson as the charismatic Mobius, a TVA bureaucrat who's hunting a time-jumping agent of chaos running loose all over the multiverse.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18404,Loki,1,It's that kind of easy banter which makes Loki everything Marvel fans hoped for - and a winning watch.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18405,Loki,1,Some of my favorite moments of the first two episodes were just Loki and Mobius shooting the breeze about fate and other cosmic matters in the TVA cafeteria.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18406,Loki,1,"Loki tells audiences exactly what it is, what it's going to do, and confirms that the fan love of its title character wasn't just because of his beautiful hair...He can carry the spotlight with glorious purpose and I'm going to keep tuning in.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18407,Loki,1,"It's a strange episode of television, even borderline absurdist, but of course, as things get interesting, it has to do some MCU homework that grind things to a halt.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18408,Loki,1,"Entertaining, sporadically funny, and takes some interestingly trippy turns. It reminds us why Loki the mocker made the Thor movies fun to watch.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18409,Loki,1,"Tom Hiddleston returns in the role he was born to play. He and Owen Wilson, hilarious as agent Mobius, are Marvel's new dream team in a series that has it all. In a word, wow!",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18410,Loki,1,"Terrifically entertaining, tantalisingly mysterious, and beautifully crafted.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18411,Loki,1,A stupendous series that leaps over Wandavision and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. [Full Review in Spanish],Disney+,92%,91%,130
18412,Loki,1,"""WandaVision"" and ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" had major success earlier this year, but I could argue ""Loki"" is more interesting. An emotional character study that presents Loki with his biggest obstacle yet: himself.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18413,Loki,1,"With glorious purpose, not to mention eye-popping production design and a playful chemistry between Tom Hiddleston and Owen Wilson, Loki is an ambitious, stylish and engaging series that expands the narrative universe to the next-next-next level.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18414,Loki,1,[Loki] dares to expand the walls of the MCU beyond what's known to give us a closer look at its cosmic underpinnings.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18415,Loki,1,"If you're here for the Douglas Adams-ish satire, it's some of the most fun stuff in the MCU.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18416,Loki,1,"Loki takes advantage of long form storytelling to do something deeper and more surprising than its big screen brothers, but it does so without undermining the expectations Marvel has spent more than a decade building.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18417,Loki,1,"So wonderfully seamless with the rest of the MCU, while carving out a unique space for Loki to thrive on his own; while exploring more of his identity.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18418,Loki,1,"In a different timeline, Loki would have made for an excellent Christopher Nolan movie. But in the timeline that you and I share, it's an exciting and genuinely inspired addition to Marvel storytelling.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18419,Loki,1,"Through Hiddleston's nuanced performance, we get to see Loki's quirks and qualities laid bare at last-depths of character that have only been hinted at.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18420,Loki,1,Loki works because the filmmakers and cast click perfectly and give us a series that tells a story we have never seen before.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18421,Loki,1,"Thankfully, Hiddleston does what he does best and that is to embody the Norse God to perfection.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18422,Loki,0,"Loki could well improve, now that its arduous task of educating us about multiverses, and glumly explaining Loki to himself, is with any luck behind it. Let's hope so.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18423,Loki,1,"Mobius and Loki make for an effective odd couple, with the ""full-tilt diva"", as Tony Stark put it in Avengers Assemble, butting up against the unruffled, surfer-dude energy of Wilson's agent.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18424,Loki,1,"Hiddleston's deep, purring voice and Shakespearean training also do wonders for Loki's melodramatic speeches, flourishing in this new Disney+ miniseries. The rest of the show, however, is less impressive.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18425,Loki,1,"The breezy attitude seems right for the show's scant six episodes, which will roll out on Wednesdays. He may be the God of mischief and a mass murderer but Loki knows how to show you a good time.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18426,Loki,1,"The devil is in the details of ""Loki,"" but we promise you that devil is not Mephisto.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18427,Loki,1,"Hiddleston seamlessly slides back into the Asgardian God role as the annoying, obnoxious adopted brother of Thor.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18428,Loki,1,"Further proof that when Marvel colour outside the intended lines, they manage their own canvas that's just as attractive and infinitely more interesting.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18429,Loki,1,"Marvel has another hit! Loki is smart and witty. A self-proclaimed ""mischievous scamp,"" we love to see what trouble Loki finds next.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18430,Loki,1,"The Beetlejuice-like atmosphere and wildly creative details of the TVA are hugely appealing, as is how the exploration of time will challenge Loki to assess/reassess his actions.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18431,Loki,1,"Balancing the standard Marvel comedy with strong character beats and heart-tugging moments, Loki is a well-balanced series that never once takes itself too seriously.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18432,Loki,1,"With an entertaining mystery wrapped in a time travelling adventure, paired with expansive world building and creative productionLoki is off to a strong start.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18433,Loki,1,You're going to have to pay close attention to know what the hell is going on in this colorfully convoluted world that is Loki the TV series.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18434,Loki,1,"The most cinematic Marvel show to date in large part thanks to Hiddleston & Wilson. Very strong across the board. A bit slow in parts, but overall top notch entertainment.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18435,Loki,1,"The god of mischief is back! Time is on Loki's side with charm, humor and a dash of humanity. Easily the best Marvel series to date.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18436,Loki,1,"If you're a fan of the power of conversation akin to an Aaron Sorkin work, you're going to love 'Loki.' You'll adjust to its pace and will be excited by its detective mystery. Owen Wilson [is] perfectly cast!",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18437,Loki,1,"Loki has a lot of potential, but in the first two episodes at least, a sluggish narrative and four phases worth of back story weigh things down more than we'd like.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18438,Loki,0,It's nevertheless a bit of a letdown when you realize halfway through the dense first episode that one of the MCU's ostensibly most unpredictable lead characters has somehow landed in the most predictable of setups.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18439,Loki,1,"Loki can get bogged down in its discussion of timelines and multiverses... but thankfully the creative team keeps the narrative engine humming, filling the screen with eye-catching details.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18440,Loki,1,"The set design for Loki is top-notch, evoking Terry Gilliam's Brazil with its art deco depiction of the TVA's base of operations, while nifty visual effects are employed to keep Loki ""chained up"" and to dispatch agents to time period after time period.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18441,Loki,1,"The episodic nature of the series gives the story time to breathe, and Loki and Mobius spend a lot of scenes just sitting in chairs and talking. And it's never boring!",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18442,Loki,1,"The TVA's inclusion in this series is a stroke of genius, creating an apparatus to excises Loki from the main MCU while also creating a vast fantasy/sci-fi playground of all time and space for Hiddleston to play in.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18443,Loki,1,"""Loki '' really is really just a character study of one particularly complex and - as Loki fans will attest - fun character. Moreover, a second season has been ordered, so the potential for ""variant"" timelines - and do-overs - multiply from there.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18444,Loki,1,"The chemistry between Wilson and Hiddleston is great, with the pair able to seamlessly transition from throwing barbs to contemplating serious revelations.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18445,Loki,1,"Perhaps in its greatest accomplishment, Loki has now changed my perspective on Wilson - for the better!",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18446,Loki,1,"A lot of rigamarole, a lot of time travel jargon and an entirely new science fiction side of the [MCU], but at the very least it succeeds as a showcase for Hiddleston's mischievous smile. It also might give Disney+ its first genuinely good Marvel series",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18447,Loki,1,"The first two episodes of Loki are extremely exciting and this has the potential to be the best of the MCU spin-off shows from 2021. Let's hope it continues to be weird, dystopian and gorgeous to look at.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18448,Loki,1,"Loki is a genre-defying series that is at once bizarre, funny, thrilling and did I say weird already?",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18449,Loki,1,"Much like Loki himself, I suspect the Loki series is a trickster. It is setting us up ever so slowly in order to double-cross us with irresistible mischief.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18450,Loki,1,Loki is a lot of fun and takes us on a thrilling sense of adventure while keeping the Marvel spirit in tone.,Disney+,92%,91%,130

18456,Loki,1,The key to Loki-both the character and the show-is always Tom Hiddleston.,Disney+,92%,91%,130
18457,Loki,1,"The approach is bold, the pacing is brisk, and the mix of humor within the narrative is perfectly balanced.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18458,Loki,1,"The wit and wackiness on display here is tempered by life-and-death stakes, as early on a clear mystery of sorts is established, offering up just a touch of a classic procedural format to help ground the action.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18459,Loki,1,"After two episodes, Loki is at a tipping point. Having set everything up to an exhausting degree, things could be lined up to get really entertaining.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18460,Loki,0,"It's interesting to think and write about-a show that's about control, order, chaos, and the unknowable notions of free will, determinism, and choice-but mildly entertaining, at best, as a whole.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18461,Loki,1,"A longtime favorite of MCU fans, Hiddleston has never been better as the God of Mischief, savoring every arrogant syllable of his (frequent) soliloquys, while also being given more opportunity than ever before to explore the character's nature.",Disney+,92%,91%,130
18462,Loki,1,"Nothing can prepare you for Loki, a mind-bending dive into the Marvel Multiverse that takes everything you thought you knew about the MCU and turns it on its head for one of the most ambitious, craziest stories Marvel Studios has ever told.",Disney+,92%,91%,130

18615,WandaVision,1,The first three episodes are all set up with a ton of metatext on sitcoms with two underserved Avengers. Not enough to judge yet.,Disney+,91%,88%,192
18616,WandaVision,1,"I'd say stay tuned. But I feel that is just what Disney might want me to do. Dang superheroes. They've saved the day once again, at least for now.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18617,WandaVision,1,WandaVision is unlike anything that the MCU has ever done.,Disney+,91%,88%,192
18618,WandaVision,1,What WandaVision truly is though - is a Marvel. A highly addictive slice of engrossing escapism that's also a wonderful celebration of television itself.,Disney+,91%,88%,192
18619,WandaVision,1,"If the show gets more intriguing with each episode, its easter eggs and character teases and references to HYDRA also become harder for a casual MCU viewer to parse.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18620,WandaVision,1,"It's great TV on its own merits. But for those who relish these stories but always want them to reach further, WandaVision is a true triumph.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18621,WandaVision,1,Consider WandaVision an unusual first step for this new Marvel phase. The best parts lovingly conjure the mood of very old television shows. The worst parts feel like just another movie.,Disney+,91%,88%,192
18622,WandaVision,1,"WandaVision also excels as a visual history of the TV comedy, transitioning to the bright candy colors of the 1970s by the third episode (the last available for review) as the comical complications of their dislocated domesticity grow.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18623,WandaVision,1,"That said, the show does a great job of reintroducing fans into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it sets the table nicely for any new fans to the superhero genre who are just interested in a new series (even if you're not interested in superhero films).",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18624,WandaVision,1,"While a slow burn on the mystery could be disappointing, WandaVision is likely to remain highly watchable thanks to its titular duo. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany are an absolute joy, and effortlessly emulate the performance styles of yesteryear.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18625,WandaVision,1,"At times, some of the jokes felt like they were only for me. So if you, like me, are a fan of classic situational comedies, well you are in for a treat. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, I literally have no idea how you will react to WandaVision",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18626,WandaVision,1,As a loving pastiche of creaky American sitcoms WandaVision is endearing. And Olsen and Bettany are clearly having a hoot in their retro frocks and dad sweaters. But it's that rising dread that will bring Marvel fans scrambling back for more.,Disney+,91%,88%,192
18627,WandaVision,1,"With a clear affection for its corny inspirations, WandaVision manages to avoid the easy punchline.",Disney+,91%,88%,192

18629,WandaVision,1,It's rare to encounter a TV show that remains enjoyable in spite of how little information it gives the audience.,Disney+,91%,88%,192
18630,WandaVision,1,"It's enjoying itself as a sincerely respectful homage to the sitcom format, whilst offering [Elizabeth] Olsen and especially [Paul] Bettany the rare chance to flex their comedic muscle in the most joyous fashion possible.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18631,WandaVision,1,"If WandaVision is a bellwether for the level of experimentation and creativity we can expect from [Disney+'s MCU shows], we might not be in the worst hands.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18632,WandaVision,1,"WandaVision is tapping into a power that the MCU has been sitting on for a decade, and like Wanda ripping Thanos apart in Endgame, it's about time we see what this thing can really do.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18633,WandaVision,1,WandVision works best precisely because it is unlike anything the MCU's model has ever produced before.,Disney+,91%,88%,192
18634,WandaVision,1,"If you were looking for charming stars to convey a Mary Tyler Moore/Dick Van Dyke vibe, you couldn't do much better as Olsen and Bettany get to spell out the sweet chemistry that the movies have only hinted at.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18635,WandaVision,0,"Once WandaVision starts recycling the same content in each episode, it becomes difficult to ignore that the show's primary interest is playing with form rather than propelling its story forward.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18636,WandaVision,1,"There are enough precarious moments in each ""WandaVision"" episode that make it clear the show might not work at all, in fact, without a nuanced actor like Olsen tethering it to some kind of reality.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18637,WandaVision,1,"""A Marvel deep-dive into America's treasure chest of telly treats""",Disney+,91%,88%,192

18641,WandaVision,1,"Unabashed, off-kilter, and unlike anything Marvel has ever attempted, WandaVision is a reality-warping joy that promises a new beginning of the MCU.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18642,WandaVision,1,"The more unexplained moments the show throws at us, and the more it pushes up against what feels like horror, the more it allows the sitcom device to really hammer home its uncanny artificiality.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18643,WandaVision,1,"Something genuinely different from the MCU. Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany & the creative team do a wonderful job recreating classic sitcoms, plus a really good Marvel mystery!",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18644,WandaVision,1,"It's just refreshing to see something that doesn't feel anything like Marvel, but still somehow fits right into the MCU.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18645,WandaVision,1,"The MCU is thinking outside of the box here, and Olsen is on another level. WandaVision is as creative, exciting, and fresh as expected.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18646,WandaVision,1,"The ever so slightly gnawing tedium of [It] suggests that Marvel's reach has not yet become so total that it can plug its characters into literally anything... But, the show is a good enough that it ought to be a big hit.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18647,WandaVision,1,"This ambitious new offering is a breath of fresh air for Marvel, breaking free of the formulaic... blockbusters for a decidedly different approach... hopefully the creativity of WandaVision is a taste of things to come for Marvel.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18648,WandaVision,1,"WandaVision is a quirky, mysterious, and increasingly engrossing addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that boasts a particularly wonderful turn from Elizabeth Olsen.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18649,WandaVision,1,"I'm digging ""The Truman Show"" style of it all, but the jury is still out if the gamble will ultimately pay off or become tiresome.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18650,WandaVision,1,Some inspired moments start to lose their effectiveness because there's less story than there is time to fill. But a new regime brings with it a greater chance that the payoff will justify the patience.,Disney+,91%,88%,192
18651,WandaVision,1,"WandaVision is a major stylistic leap for the MCU, and nearly impossible to resist, if you've been invested in these stories for over a decade now - a mind-bending appetiser before we dine in the multiverse.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18652,WandaVision,1,"Above all, it's delightful to watch superhero characters in a big-budget outing and not have a clue what's going to happen next.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18653,WandaVision,1,"A love letter to sitcoms and the perfect show to bring us back into the MCU, WandaVision is Marvel's most exciting project yet,with an unmissable, Emmy-worthy performance from Elizabeth Olsen.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18654,WandaVision,1,"""WandaVision"" teases a lot of grief and trauma, but initially is content to play sitcom house and toy around with silly TV homages and tropes.",Disney+,91%,88%,192
18655,WandaVision,1,Director Matt Shakman and head writer Jared Schaeffer have created a dazzling and vibrant extension of the Marvel Universe that exudes originality and excite fans.,Disney+,91%,88%,192
18656,WandaVision,1,This show is banana pants crazy -- in the best way possible! Stick with it and there are sure to be some MAJOR Marvel style reveals and action sequences!,Disney+,91%,88%,192
18657,Hawkeye,1,"While Hawkeye doesn't feel like anything particularly special within the larger MCU, it provides a few thrills as well as strong introductions to several characters who hopefully shine better once they take center-stage in their own stories.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18658,Hawkeye,1,"More exceptional Marvel and Disney excitement. All said, Jeremy Renner did a great job, as did Hailee Steinfeld, but the truest bit of excitement for me was when Native actress Alaqua Cox made it on screen. An appreciative shout to Zahn McClarnon as well.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18659,Hawkeye,0,"If you are very much plugged into the Marvel Universe, yes its a Must Watch. If youre not that bothered, then no.",Disney+,92%,91%,94

18662,Hawkeye,1,"Though the show lacks the depth of Wanda or the far-reaching implications of Loki, it has a humanity that makes its material easier to relate to.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18663,Hawkeye,1,"Hawkeye is a great journey with plenty of Christmas warmth, action, humour and some good character development for Hawkeyes both old and new.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18664,Hawkeye,1,The series quickly settles in the Marvel factory mold. [Full review in Spanish],Disney+,92%,91%,94
18665,Hawkeye,1,Hawkeye is an entertaining romp that doesn't feel as bound by the MCU timeline.,Disney+,92%,91%,94
18666,Hawkeye,1,"A lot of fun, and it counts as a holiday series at that...",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18667,Hawkeye,1,"What it lacks in plot, however, it more than makes up for in the delightful pairing of Renner and Steinfeld who boast enough charm, charisma and star-wattage power to just about keep the show on the road.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18668,Hawkeye,1,"It's a little early to call this show a bullseye, however, it's a fun game to watch.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18669,Hawkeye,0,"For a series about a pair of sharpshooters, Hawkeye frustratingly misses the mark too often. Well, at least for viewers who aren't its target audience.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18670,Hawkeye,1,Steinfeld brings a charm and strong will to Kate which makes her the perfect choice to take over the Hawkeye name. Steinfeld and Renner make a great duo with great chemistry and humor.,Disney+,92%,91%,94
18671,Hawkeye,1,"It doesn't feel entirely necessary in the increasingly bloated Marvel Universe, but this miniseries is still an enjoyable holiday trifle for superhero fans.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18672,Hawkeye,1,"This six-part Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) series is another cleverly conceived, brilliantly cast piece of the Phase 4-puzzle.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18673,Hawkeye,1,If you miss this one it's not clear if you will have any trouble following whatever comes up next in the movies. Although it must be said this show is still more entertaining than all three hours of Eternals.,Disney+,92%,91%,94
18674,Hawkeye,0,"Steinfeld deserves a better introduction than this piece of tinsel which, in its first two episodes, never transcends the rating of fine.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18675,Hawkeye,0,"The show has so little faith in our interest in Clint Barton as a character that it buries his best moments under a sea of Kate Bishop screentime and backstory, hoping the shiny new hero will appease audiences more than Renner's veteran.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18676,Hawkeye,1,What's the best way to handle a humorless Avenger? Put him in as many scenes as possible where he's made to feel uncomfortable and watch the comedy flow.,Disney+,92%,91%,94
18677,Hawkeye,1,"Hawkeye works because of the chemistry between Renner and Steinfeld, but also because it prioritizes character slightly more than action.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18678,Hawkeye,1,"The old Marvel adage goes that even when it's bad it's good. Not to say that Hawkeye is bad, but it's certainly not the best MCU show - and that's okay.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18679,Hawkeye,1,"This is Kate's journey and Steinfeld runs with it, proving that she may very well be the actress of her generation.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18680,Hawkeye,1,Bullseye!,Disney+,92%,91%,94
18681,Hawkeye,1,"The series was loosely inspired by the excellent Matt Fraction and David Aja run of Hawkeye comics, and some of that fun makes its way into the show.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18682,Hawkeye,1,"Renner and Steinfeld have great chemistry together, and their odd couple/buddy cop routine is delightful even when they're not embroiled in action sequences.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18683,Hawkeye,1,Clint Barton and Kate Bishop make a fine team together and one can't wait to see what happens next in Hawkeye.,Disney+,92%,91%,94
18684,Hawkeye,1,has a more grounded feel than the rest of the MCU shows but I liked that about it,Disney+,92%,91%,94
18685,Hawkeye,1,Hawkeye is a perfect tribute to New York City and delivers a fun odd couple duo with grumpy Clint partnering with hero-in-training Kate.,Disney+,92%,91%,94
18686,Hawkeye,1,"While the show takes plenty of story beats from the 2012 comic series, it manages to translate the feel of that arc into the wider narrative playing out in the MCU.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18687,Hawkeye,1,A 90s styled throwback buddy comedy that brings back personalization and grounded fun to the MCU.,Disney+,92%,91%,94
18688,Hawkeye,1,"Call us intrigued by but not smitten with this first third of Hawkeye. If the worst case is it proves to be little more than a light holiday treat, it's hard to be too much of a Grinch about that.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18689,Hawkeye,1,"A fun, free-wheeling action show energized by scene-stealing Hailee Steinfeld, who joins grouchy archer Jeremy Renner for some good honest comfort viewing.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18690,Hawkeye,1,Hawkeye is the kind of entertainment that's just right for this Holiday Season. It's fun action with some laughs provided by good-hearted characters in a plot that's simple and uncomplicated.,Disney+,92%,91%,94
18691,Hawkeye,1,It's got all the elements you'd expect from a Marvel series. It's a lot of fun.,Disney+,92%,91%,94
18692,Hawkeye,1,"It's in that simplicity that Hawkeye really shines, making it a series unlike any of the other Marvel shows we've seen so far.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18693,Hawkeye,1,"Just like Clint's still-mysterious adventures as Ronin have yet to be revealed in full, Maya's story still has plenty of time to come into focus, as the MCU's past and future meet in Hawkeye.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18694,Hawkeye,0,Hawkeye feels like it will end up being a quick wiki article scan to get caught up on where everything stands instead of its own standalone story.,Disney+,92%,91%,94
18695,Hawkeye,1,Hawkeye' is going to be an enjoyable romp that won't tax the brain or require anything other than for you to have a good time.,Disney+,92%,91%,94
18696,Hawkeye,1,"Hawkeye feels like the most grounded, self-aware project in the MCU to date.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18697,Hawkeye,1,"Whether this chemistry will work is hard to tell at the outset. For MCU fans, however, it is comfort food, a lighter version of a stand-alone movie with well-executed action and an often wry sense of humour.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18698,Hawkeye,1,Hawkeye may not be a resounding bullseye but it hits the spot well enough.,Disney+,92%,91%,94
18699,Hawkeye,1,"Based on the comic book series created by Matt Fraction, it has a relaxed, low-key vibe, emphasizing the great chemistry between Renner and Hailee Steinfeld as much as the action.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18700,Hawkeye,1,"[Like] the title character, Hawkeye has the same issue: it lacks branding. Sure, Disney might know how to sell it, but the TV series doesn't know what it's about. At least not yet.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18701,Hawkeye,0,This series lacks the zip and polish that Kate Bishop and Clint Barton deserve.,Disney+,92%,91%,94
18702,Hawkeye,1,Hawkeye refreshes a character that had been pushed to the sidelines with undeniable chemistry and an incredibly promising new leading character.,Disney+,92%,91%,94
18703,Hawkeye,1,"With the tired and tested [Jeremy] Renner bouncing comfortably off the enthusiastic, comedically gifted [Hailee] Steinfeld, the future looks bright for a show I'm sure many had their reservations about.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18704,Hawkeye,1,"Rooted in character development yet still dotted with the action MCU fans clamour for, 'Hawkeye' soars on the sparkling dynamic between its two leads.",Disney+,92%,91%,94

18706,Hawkeye,1,"Stuffed with humor and heart, Hawkeye has a lot to offer MCU fans new and old.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18707,Hawkeye,1,"Simply put, in just one episode, Hawkeye does more for the character than 10 years in the MCU has.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18708,Hawkeye,1,"Peak performances from the cast, writing on full ignition, action that thrills, and a lot of room to tell what looks to be a fulfilling coming-of-age for one buddy and the reconciling of the past for the other. Die Hard and Lethal Weapon would be proud.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18709,Hawkeye,1,Hawkeye rocks a great mix of playfulness and a sense of real danger. It's also hard to imagine better casting for Kate Bishop than Hailee Steinfeld. Her timing and tone are always spot on and her chemistry with Jeremy Renner is a major highlight.,Disney+,92%,91%,94
18710,Hawkeye,0,"Hailee Steinfeld shines, but the rest is forgettable. It says a lot that the Avengers musical, a show within the show, is currently the best thing about this show.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18711,Hawkeye,1,"Yes, people can and will get hurt. But in a world where doom and gloom seem to be all over our media, ""Hawkeye"" uses the character's best superpower to save the day-heart. And sometimes that's all you need.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18712,Hawkeye,1,So firmly locked on target with the Marvel Cinematic Universe formula that it's clearly destined to be another Disney+ month-long viewing addiction.,Disney+,92%,91%,94
18713,Hawkeye,1,"Jonathan Igla balances the traditional Marvel action with a lot of humor in Hawkeye. Placing it in New York City at Christmas time gives it a joyous aesthetic, and It lives in a nerdy, self-depreciating world.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18714,Hawkeye,1,Hawkeye gets off to a good enough start that I'm curious to see where it goes even if it hasn't entirely gripped me as a viewer.,Disney+,92%,91%,94
18715,Hawkeye,1,"Returning to the simplicity of the franchise's first phase, the series is ground-level MCU at its very finest. As someone who never thought a Hawkeye-centric production would EVER work, I'm pleasantly surprised at how great this show is.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18716,Hawkeye,1,"Hawkeye episodes one and two are an awesome blend of the Matt Fraction/David Aja series and Christmas. Fans of Clint Barton are getting the character they've been waiting for in live-action, and Kate Bishop is going to be everyone's new favorite hero.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18717,Hawkeye,1,"When it focuses on its leads, it has the potential to be a relatively diverting, if airless, chapter of the Marvel universe - one unfettered thus far by the weight of Phase Four's multiverse mishegas.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18718,Hawkeye,1,"By showing Clint away from Avengers duties, Hawkeye has turned the character's weaknesses across the films-his normalcy and vulnerability-into his greatest assets.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18719,Hawkeye,1,"Adapting Matt Fraction and David Aja's character-defining run of Hawkeye is no easy feat, but in the new Disney+ series, it's clear that Marvel understands the assignment.",Disney+,92%,91%,94

18722,Hawkeye,1,"While you might have - some very reasonable - Marvel fatigue, their final show of 2021, Hawkeye, is here to charm and delight even the most cynical viewers.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18723,Hawkeye,0,"""Hawkeye"" is clearly more concerned with setting up Kate Bishop for future MCU phases than creating a problem worthy of two heroes' time. And at six hours, it's certainly not worthy of yours.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18724,Hawkeye,1,"Like the best of the MCU on Disney Plus so far, including WandaVision and Loki, Hawkeye stands on its own just enough to largely avoid superhero fatigue.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18725,Hawkeye,0,"Even a show that approaches its episodic run like an extra-long movie owes the audience a bit more momentum than this, especially when those installments roll out weekly.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18726,Hawkeye,1,"Steinfeld and Renner are good foils for each other, as Bishop pushes Barton to relax and he tends to her like a fussy aunt.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18727,Hawkeye,0,"""Hawkeye"" is too beholden to the larger MCU as a guiding narrative force and generic house style of filming to truly find its own voice...",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18728,Hawkeye,1,"Taken by itself, Hawkeye is a perfectly serviceable action romp. But when there's so many of these things saturating the market, it needs to work a little harder to justify its own existence.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18729,Hawkeye,1,"""Hawkeye"" is a nice return to Earth after all the cosmic stuff we've seen lately. It's a reminder of why you fell in love with the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the first place.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18730,Hawkeye,1,"For lovers of the comic, the series nails specific aspects - the ones that count.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18731,Hawkeye,0,"Acknowledging that the character is the least-exciting Avenger can be fun in small doses, but it's not a thing to base an entire series on.",Disney+,92%,91%,94

18733,Hawkeye,1,"Welcome back, old MCU, we've missed you.Clint and Kate have made their way into my heart as Marvel's most iconic duo.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18734,Hawkeye,1,Hawkeye does just as wonderful of a job exploring Kate Bishop as it does the title hero himself. This cheerful and action-packed series is off to a good start.,Disney+,92%,91%,94
18735,Hawkeye,1,"Clint Barton has not always been the easiest Avenger to rally behind, and Hawkeye doesn't look to make him more likeable. It does double down on what makes Clint such an interesting paradox of a man.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18736,Hawkeye,0,"The action scenes are perfunctory, the dialogue glum rather than glittering. And the mentor-protégée chemistry between Renner and Steinfeld might be kindly described as a work in progress.",Disney+,92%,91%,94
18737,Hawkeye,1,It remains to be seen whether or not the payoff will be as compelling as the setup.,Disney+,92%,91%,94

18743,Hawkeye,1,"It starts off a little slow, and seems lower budget than previous Marvel Disney+ shows. But Renner & Steinfeld are both super charismatic so the show is a lot of fun.",Disney+,92%,91%,94

18894,Star Wars Rebels,1,"If you haven't seen Star Wars Rebels, you're gonna want to catch up. Much like The Clone Wars, it's got some of the strongest and most creative storytelling in the Star Wars franchise, but gets unfairly ignored by virtue of being an animated series.",Disney+,98%,83%,10

18897,Star Wars Rebels,1,"This isn't to suggest that tonight's episode, 'Rebel Assault', is a bad installment or that it takes the season off track - quite the opposite, in fact - but having it serve as midseason finale makes for an arbitrary point in the action to hit pause.",Disney+,98%,83%,10

18903,"Love, Victor",0,"Whether the fantasy ending is due to an early cancellation or the desire to tie everything up with a tidy bow, this final season is unsatisfying. The characters are shadows of themselves, and the interesting messiness (and queer focus) is all but gone",Disney+,93%,82%,13

18909,"Love, Victor",1,"Love, Victor is aware of its lane and it’s pleasantly happy to stay on cruise control for its last set of episodes. That might sound like I’m being sarcastic, but “approachable high school fairy tale” is a vibe, and they’re right to ride it.",Disney+,93%,82%,13

18934,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Creator Drew Goddard and Erik Oleson have created an adept season that goes back to its roots, but also grows from them. This tortured hero has an exceptional arc, across from a menacing villain, with an assortment of significant side characters.",Disney+,92%,89%,65
18935,Marvel's Daredevil,1,I just enjoyed a lot of the backstory about Daredevil that was explored more this time.,Disney+,92%,89%,65

18941,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"While flawed, the third season of Daredevil delivers on its promise to shock and entertain, to grant us deeper insight into a tormented hero with everything to lose.",Disney+,92%,89%,65
18942,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Sure, there are still pacing issues (13 eps is still too many), but it's also weirdly refreshing to see a season without a single cameo or surprise guest from another part of the Marvel universe.",Disney+,92%,89%,65
18943,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"While the ""brave hero who loses everything and believes he has to put himself on an island to win"" trope is infuriatingly overplayed, it seems to work for season three.",Disney+,92%,89%,65
18944,Marvel's Daredevil,1,I could show this to anybody... the accessibility level of this show is amazing.,Disney+,92%,89%,65
18945,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"But more important than fidelity to the source material is the result. In that, Season 3 excels, with the six episodes provided for review representing the best of the series, and, arguably, of Netflix's corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",Disney+,92%,89%,65
18946,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Oleson and Co. have crafted such a dense, dark set-up here that, for the first time since Jessica Jones' first season, diving back into the streets of Hell's Kitchen feels more like a treat than a chore. Thank God.",Disney+,92%,89%,65
18947,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"The show may never have the spark it did in its earliest days, but it did help elevate the way stories of superheroes can be told on television. There's still progress to be made, but ""Daredevil"" feels like it's on the right track.",Disney+,92%,89%,65
18948,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"But good news, Daredevil fans, the third season-which drops in its entirety this week-is genuinely good again thanks in no small part to the return of Vincent D'Onofrio as the devilishly menacing Kingpin.",Disney+,92%,89%,65
18949,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"As strong as season three of Daredevil was, here's hoping Netflix grabs the devil by the horns and graces us with another installment.",Disney+,92%,89%,65
18950,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Gone is the mystical nonsense of The Hand and K'un-Lun, replaced by the sheer brilliance and brutality of the return of Wilson Fisk. He was a key part of why season 1 was so great, but here in season 3, Fisk has been fully unleashed.",Disney+,92%,89%,65

18959,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"All the things you liked about season 1 are here: the innovative cinematography, the creative manipulation of flashbacks, the brutal close hand-to-hand beatdowns. Some of these shots, as stills, are worthy of art classes all by themselves.",Disney+,92%,89%,65
18960,Marvel's Daredevil,1,Daredevil's third season is a return to form.,Disney+,92%,89%,65
18961,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"The new baddie's arrival on the scene is perhaps one of the new season's best achievements -- not simply because of the character's popularity in the comics, but due to the careful manner by which the writers and Bethel breathe life into him.",Disney+,92%,89%,65
18962,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Perhaps more than any show in the whole Marvel-Netflix Globular Cluster, Daredevil makes me question everything I like and everything I dislike about the Heroes for Hire and their simultaneously intriguing and mind-numbing transits through space-time.",Disney+,92%,89%,65
18963,Marvel's Daredevil,0,"Despite marquee villains new and old, the Man Without Fear thus risks becoming the Series That Induces Sleep.",Disney+,92%,89%,65

18966,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Unlike the previous two seasons, Season 3 minimizes Matt and his moral dilemmas to make more room for what is truly one of Marvel's best supporting casts.",Disney+,92%,89%,65
18967,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Just as Matt Murdock rises from the ashes and rubble to save Hell's Kitchen one more time, Daredevil Season 3 could potentially do the same for Marvel shows on Netflix.",Disney+,92%,89%,65
18968,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"[Season 3] is a strong outing,... as new showrunner Erik Oleson reorients the Man Without Fear to very much be full of fear and obstacles as he attempts to climb his way out of the debris of everything that has come before.",Disney+,92%,89%,65
18969,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"While the show definitely unpacks the moral gray areas its players exist in, the characters' conceptualizations of themselves are all very black and white.",Disney+,92%,89%,65
18970,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Vincent D'Onofrio continues to give a rich, powerful, and intense performance as Fisk. Many say that he is one of the best comic book villains in the MCU and I would argue he's one of the best in the superhero genre.",Disney+,92%,89%,65
18971,Marvel's Daredevil,1,There are things to love. There are things not to love. Matt is great. Fisk is great. Bullseye is awesome. Everything not involving those three people is... okay.,Disney+,92%,89%,65
18972,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"At the center of it all, there is Vincent D'Onofrio's Kingpin. Desperately missed from season two, the show once again feels at home telling the parallel stories of Matt Murdock and Wilson Fisk.",Disney+,92%,89%,65

18975,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Three seasons in, I feel confident saying that Daredevil is not only the most consistent show Marvel has produced, but it's also episode-for-episode the best.",Disney+,92%,89%,65
18976,Marvel's Daredevil,0,Where does this go from here? Can Daredevil survive a fourth season? Or is it time for the character to hang up his horns for good?,Disney+,92%,89%,65
18977,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"There's a linear flow to it all that is focused and efficient. That doesn't mean the show couldn't lose steam like so many other promising yet still flawed Marvel series on Netflix. But so far, so good.",Disney+,92%,89%,65
18978,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"With explosive, intense action sequences, fascinating character work, and nuanced performances from its lead cast, Daredevil Season 3 is absolutely a return to form - and that goes for both the show itself and the Netflix corner of the MCU as a whole.",Disney+,92%,89%,65
18979,Marvel's Daredevil,1,"While it's partly let down by its glacially-paced first three episodes, Daredevil season 3 manages to find its footing before long. Fans of the ongoing battle between Matt Murdock and Kingpin will not be disappointed.",Disney+,92%,89%,65

18981,Star Wars: The Bad Batch,1,"A few less-than-stellar episodes knocks it down a bit, but it's still well worth watching, especially the final few episodes.",Disney+,85%,82%,15
18982,Star Wars: The Bad Batch,1,"The animated series isn't as flashy as The Mandalorian, but finds ways to reward the people most invested in its story",Disney+,85%,82%,15
18983,Star Wars: The Bad Batch,1,"In the end, The Bad Batch is a fun outing for hardcore Star Wars fans who want to know every aspect of the universe. But for those who are just looking for another Mandalorian, well, these are not the clones you are looking for.",Disney+,85%,82%,15
18984,Star Wars: The Bad Batch,1,"The Bad Batch is catnip for the dedicated Star Wars fans. It's an animated action-adventure series with thrills, relatable characters on the right side of the war, blaster guns and enough lore and easter eggs to invoke a few excited squeals.",Disney+,85%,82%,15
18985,Star Wars: The Bad Batch,1,"I'm not a superfan of Star Wars animated series, but I am impressed with this one, a team of certifiable rejects, each with their own skillset, is a winning formula for me - excellent actually",Disney+,85%,82%,15

18990,Star Wars: The Bad Batch,1,A great show that hooks on the quirky adventures of Clone Force 99. [Full Review in Spanish],Disney+,85%,82%,15

19009,Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,1,"It ended on a surprisingly quiet, bittersweet note, an ending sequence that-much like the heroes who gather together one year after their team called it quits-is a little sad, a little funny, and feels over before it's really begun.",Disney+,95%,91%,15

19190,Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"After seeing the first six episodes, this is what I got: the sophomore season is in fact better than its original outing.

19191,Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"...Iron Fist is a straight-up chock-socky beat 'em up, and that's fine.",Disney+,37%,68%,47
19192,Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"If you tapped out during Season One, Season Two is definitely worth a revisit. Its better, less clunky, moves at a fast clip, all the characters are now established and ready to kick ass and chew bubble gum.",Disney+,37%,68%,47
19193,Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Atill struggling with the same generic Marvel-on-Netflix issue: a master plot that just isn't dense enough to stretch over the episode order, leading to stop-and-start pacing, repetitive conversations and secondary characters that overstay their welcome.",Disney+,37%,68%,47
19194,Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Yet drastically improved action sequences...just aren't enough to salvage Iron Fist, let alone keep general audiences interested.",Disney+,37%,68%,47

19198,Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"Season 2, with its 10 episodes, is faster paced, and its revenge plot more straightforward, leaving room for character development - even if that character isn't Danny Rand.",Disney+,37%,68%,47
19199,Marvel's Iron Fist,0,It's much better paced and way easier to watch. But coming back from what was a truly lack-luster first season... was going to take a complete overhaul of the series and it's hard to say if that was ever going to be possible.,Disney+,37%,68%,47
19200,Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Iron Fist Season 2 marks an improvement over its well-derided freshman run, but still lacks punch.",Disney+,37%,68%,47
19201,Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"A massive improvement in virtually every way that matters. A new showrunner, a new fight coordinator... all help tremendously, along with better villains, a more focused story, and a willingness to put the show's supporting cast to better use.",Disney+,37%,68%,47
19202,Marvel's Iron Fist,0,Iron Fist's sophomore season isn't able to right the many wrongs from its first. Don't waste your time on this one.,Disney+,37%,68%,47
19203,Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"Basically, Iron Fist heard all the complaints about Season 1 and was like, ""I'll show you!"" And then it did.",Disney+,37%,68%,47

19211,Marvel's Runaways,0,Their lazy symbolism made the show a miss for me.,Disney+,85%,68%,12
19212,Marvel's Runaways,1,Season 3 does a beautiful job of wrapping up stories in a way that makes the ending satisfying while also dropping a few clear hints of things that could have been explored.,Disney+,85%,68%,12
19213,Marvel's Runaways,1,"Wisely, Runaways doesn't waste time in starting to tie up those loose ends.",Disney+,85%,68%,12
19214,Marvel's Runaways,1,"Whilst the third and final season of Runaways is not thoroughly developed, it's a bold and poignant farewell that's tasked to reattach the dangling threads left from last season, while still admirably introducing a spellbinding new menace",Disney+,85%,68%,12
19215,Marvel's Runaways,1,"The chemistry within the ensemble - the playful banter, as well as its kookier elements - make this third season of Marvel's Runaways a distillation of what's always been fascinating.",Disney+,85%,68%,12
19216,Marvel's Runaways,1,This is when Runaways is at it's best - when the team is working as a team.,Disney+,85%,68%,12

19218,Marvel's Runaways,1,[Marvel's Runaways] were a quality start to an already action-packed season with the promise of greatness.,Disney+,85%,68%,12
19219,Marvel's Runaways,1,"It's incredibly rare to see a show address and internalize a critical dressing-down and make a hard pivot for the better, but that's what Runaways does.",Disney+,85%,68%,12
19220,Marvel's Runaways,0,"It's as though Runaways knows it should be a show about the instability and intensity of being a teenager, but lacks the courage to engage with those stakes.",Disney+,85%,68%,12
19221,Marvel's Runaways,1,"Season 3 of Runaways is everything that makes the show great, turned up to 11. The result is quite often moving and generally a lot of fun, but will nevertheless leave viewers with a bittersweet taste in their mouths.",Disney+,85%,68%,12
19222,Marvel's Runaways,1,"Runaways has been at its best, and remains at its best, when it's able to slow down and fully explore the intersection of teen drama and superhero show.",Disney+,85%,68%,12
19223,Star Wars Resistance,1,"Half-way through a season all the arc-plot begins to bunch up, and the last few episodes are genuinely engaging. It's worth a watch, but perhaps revisit the other animated shows first.",Disney+,92%,58%,4

19225,Star Wars Resistance,1,"The premiere had a very good balance of comedic moments, character drama and tension. All the comedy worked very well - even Neeku's brand of comedy worked and I was fairly impartial to him throughout the first season.",Disney+,92%,58%,4
19226,Star Wars Resistance,0,"The bottom line is that Resistance... isn't really that good, or memorable. More specifically, it's a show that really doesn't know what it wants to be.",Disney+,92%,58%,4
19227,Marvel's Agent Carter,1,"The noirish feel of old Hollywood fits the show perfectly, and between the developing mystery and deepening relationships, this season is off to a great start.",Disney+,86%,77%,21
19228,Marvel's Agent Carter,0,It became... nothing more than a Hayley Atwell vehicle that let everything else from production value to narrative importance fall to the wayside if it meant the show's lead actress getting in just one extra spunky line of dialogue.,Disney+,86%,77%,21
19229,Marvel's Agent Carter,1,"It was fun, but maybe a two-hour premiere loaded down with so much table-setting and story setup wasn't the best way to kick things off.",Disney+,86%,77%,21

19236,Marvel's Agent Carter,1,"Like last summer's Ant-Man, Agent Carter finds a way to make the smaller stakes of Peggy's noir sandbox as tense, credible, and addictively watchable as any other addition to the MCU.",Disney+,86%,77%,21
19237,Marvel's Agent Carter,1,"All the additions made to Agent Carter season 2 benefit the series, but in the end the show's success is still rooted in Hayley Atwell's central performance, which only gains more texture as she spends more time with the character.",Disney+,86%,77%,21
19238,Marvel's Agent Carter,1,These first two episodes were pretty fun. And they didn't mention Captain America once!,Disney+,86%,77%,21

19240,Marvel's Agent Carter,0,[The setup is] opting for beats so trite that they feel like they're coming out of a spy parody.,Disney+,86%,77%,21

19244,Marvel's Agent Carter,1,"Agent Carter is just far enough removed from Marvel's grand plans that the show can afford to take risks. This dual premiere doles out some clunky exposition, but it also builds a compelling foundation for a strong season.",Disney+,86%,77%,21
19245,Marvel's Agent Carter,1,Agent Carter returns tonight with its second-season debut to remind us that ABC has a powerful Marvel superhero worth praising anew.,Disney+,86%,77%,21
19246,Marvel's Agent Carter,1,"What I loved most about the very strong return of Peggy Carter was that we wasted no time debating her abilities, watching her trying to please others, or eradicate sexism.",Disney+,86%,77%,21
19247,Marvel's Agent Carter,0,"Get past the surface, though, and it once again looks as if the show has been relegated to the role of little more than handsome placeholder to break up SHIELD's season - all dressed up, perhaps, but as outfitted, with no real place to go.",Disney+,86%,77%,21
19248,Alias,1,"Alias actually got better as it wound down in this season, and the show was allowed to give us a satisfactory wrap-up.",Disney+,86%,91%,7
19249,Alias,1,"Sadly, Alias jumped the shark by going ahead with the fifth season. But for fans of the show, it was nice to actually see the show have a final episode that wrapped things up. Too often, television shows just die in the corner with no farewell episode.",Disney+,86%,91%,7
19250,Alias,1,The contrast between this mundane dimension of Sydney's life and her athletic international intrigues was genuinely fun to see.,Disney+,86%,91%,7

19440,Glee,1,You can't look at TV as it exists now and not see the influence of this slushie-soaked teen dramedy about a band of singing misfits. Glee was never perfect. At times it was even bad. But it accomplished something.,Disney+,70%,71%,18

19453,Glee,0,"It's fitting, then, that the first hour ends with a Frozen cover that's over a year late to the zeitgeist... making it feel just as the show does: dull, overextended, and irrelevant. It's Glee's time-time to let it go.",Disney+,70%,71%,18
19454,Glee,0,"While the new kids at McKinley get a few quirky gags, they feel half-hearted, as if only real remaining mission is to follow our old friends to the finish line. That's fine. But we could have done it two seasons ago and not missed much.",Disney+,70%,71%,18

19479,Monsters at Work,1,"Monsters At Work looks good and has some good moments, but it doesn't come close to being as good as Monsters, Inc. It was nice to see Goodman and Crystal back as Mike and Sully, but the series doesn't give us enough of them to make it worthwhile.",Disney+,65%,81%,26
19480,Monsters at Work,1,Monsters at Work is a wonderful addition to the Monstroplis mythos. It's filled with plenty of laughs and memorable new characters that are sure to excite fans new and old.,Disney+,65%,81%,26

19498,The Wonder Years,1,"This look back through time leans more intense toward joy than sorrow. Don Cheadle's gentle narration as adult Dean sets and maintains that tone, although Dulé Hill's calm, fatherly presence... solidifies the show's kindness.",Disney+,96%,52%,24
19499,The Wonder Years,1,"Whether the series can sustain the charms and deft balance that its pilot exhibits remains to be seen; still, just getting out of the gate this looks like one of the fall's most appealing shows.",Disney+,96%,52%,24
19500,The Wonder Years,1,"A brand new series that is technically a reboot but is thematically so much more. The writers deftly juggle two opposing ideas, arguing that the good old days weren't good for everyone, while offering the same nostalgia that we loved about the original.",Disney+,96%,52%,24
19501,The Wonder Years,1,"Both nostalgic and a painful reminder of the violence visited upon Black Americans, this Wonder Years capably walks a narrative tightrope in its premiere.",Disney+,96%,52%,24

19540,The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder,1,"While it is too early to tell whether or not it truly lives up to the legacy of the original series, the two-episode premiere largely signals that Louder and Prouder is on its way to becoming a revival series done right.",Disney+,100%,68%,5
